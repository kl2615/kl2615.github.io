and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley\\r\\nwas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.', 'The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the\\r\\nday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only\\r\\nsix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin.', 'And when\\r\\nthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five\\r\\naltogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and\\r\\nanother young man.', 'Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant\\r\\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners.', 'His sisters were fine women,\\r\\nwith an air of decided fashion.', 'His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\\r\\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\\r\\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\\r\\nthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes\\r\\nafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year.', 'The gentlemen\\r\\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he\\r\\nwas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\\r\\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\\r\\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\\r\\nproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all\\r\\nhis large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most\\r\\nforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared\\r\\nwith his friend.', 'Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\\r\\npeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\\r\\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving\\r\\none himself at Netherfield.', 'Such amiable qualities must speak for\\r\\nthemselves.', 'What a contrast between him and his friend!', 'Mr. Darcy danced\\r\\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\\r\\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\\r\\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.', 'His character was decided.', 'He was the proudest, most disagreeable man\\r\\nin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.', 'Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of\\r\\nhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his\\r\\nhaving slighted one of her daughters.', 'Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit\\r\\ndown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been\\r\\nstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.\\r\\nBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend\\r\\nto join it.', '\"Come, Darcy,\" said he, \"I must have you dance.', 'I hate to see you\\r\\nstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner.', 'You had much better\\r\\ndance.\"', '\"I certainly shall not.', 'You know how I detest it, unless I am\\r\\nparticularly acquainted with my partner.', 'At such an assembly as this\\r\\nit would be insupportable.', 'Your sisters are engaged, and there is not\\r\\nanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to\\r\\nstand up with.\"', '\"I would not be so fastidious as you are,\" cried Mr. Bingley, \"for a\\r\\nkingdom!', 'Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in\\r\\nmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see\\r\\nuncommonly pretty.\"', '\"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\" said Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.', '\"Oh!', 'She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld!', 'But there is one\\r\\nof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I\\r\\ndare say very agreeable.', 'Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\"', '\"Which do you mean?\"', 'and turning round he looked for a moment at\\r\\nElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:\\r\\n\"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no\\r\\nhumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted\\r\\nby other men.', 'You had better return to your partner and enjoy her\\r\\nsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\"', 'Mr. Bingley followed his advice.', 'Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth\\r\\nremained with no very cordial feelings toward him.', 'She told the story,\\r\\nhowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,\\r\\nplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.', 'The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.', 'Mrs.\\r\\nBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield\\r\\nparty.', 'Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been\\r\\ndistinguished by his sisters.', 'Jane was as much gratified by this as\\r\\nher mother could be, though in a quieter way.', \"Elizabeth felt Jane's\\r\\npleasure.\", 'Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most\\r\\naccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been\\r\\nfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they\\r\\nhad yet learnt to care for at a ball.', 'They returned, therefore, in good\\r\\nspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they\\r\\nwere the principal inhabitants.', 'They found Mr. Bennet still up.', 'With\\r\\na book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a\\r\\ngood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised\\r\\nsuch splendid expectations.', \"He had rather hoped that his wife's views on\\r\\nthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a\\r\\ndifferent story to hear.\", '\"Oh!', 'my dear Mr. Bennet,\" as she entered the room, \"we have had a most\\r\\ndelightful evening, a most excellent ball.', 'I wish you had been there.', 'Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.', 'Everybody said how well\\r\\nshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with\\r\\nher twice!', 'Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her\\r\\ntwice!', 'and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second\\r\\ntime.', 'First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.', 'I was so vexed to see him stand\\r\\nup with her!', 'But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody\\r\\ncan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going\\r\\ndown the dance.', 'So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and\\r\\nasked her for the two next.', 'Then the two third he danced with Miss King,\\r\\nand the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,\\r\\nand the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he had had any compassion for _me_,\" cried her husband impatiently,\\r\\n\"he would not have danced half so much!', \"For God's sake, say no more of\\r\\nhis partners.\", 'Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\"', '\"Oh!', 'my dear, I am quite delighted with him.', 'He is so excessively\\r\\nhandsome!', 'And his sisters are charming women.', 'I never in my life saw\\r\\nanything more elegant than their dresses.', 'I dare say the lace upon Mrs.\\r\\nHurst\\'s gown--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere she was interrupted again.', 'Mr. Bennet protested against any\\r\\ndescription of finery.', 'She was therefore obliged to seek another branch\\r\\nof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some\\r\\nexaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.', '\"But I can assure you,\" she added, \"that Lizzy does not lose much by not\\r\\nsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at\\r\\nall worth pleasing.', 'So high and so conceited that there was no enduring\\r\\nhim!', 'He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very\\r\\ngreat!', 'Not handsome enough to dance with!', 'I wish you had been there, my\\r\\ndear, to have given him one of your set-downs.', 'I quite detest the man.\"', 'Chapter 4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in\\r\\nher praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very\\r\\nmuch she admired him.', '\"He is just what a young man ought to be,\" said she, \"sensible,\\r\\ngood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much\\r\\nease, with such perfect good breeding!\"', '\"He is also handsome,\" replied Elizabeth, \"which a young man ought\\r\\nlikewise to be, if he possibly can.', 'His character is thereby complete.\"', '\"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time.', 'I\\r\\ndid not expect such a compliment.\"', '\"Did not you?', 'I did for you.', 'But that is one great difference between\\r\\nus.', 'Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never.', 'What\\r\\ncould be more natural than his asking you again?', 'He could not help\\r\\nseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman\\r\\nin the room.', 'No thanks to his gallantry for that.', 'Well, he certainly is\\r\\nvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him.', 'You have liked many a\\r\\nstupider person.\"', '\"Dear Lizzy!\"', '\"Oh!', 'you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.', 'You never see a fault in anybody.', 'All the world are good and agreeable\\r\\nin your eyes.', 'I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your\\r\\nlife.\"', '\"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone;

and with more\\r\\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,\\r\\nand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she\\r\\nwas very little disposed to approve them.', 'They were in fact very fine\\r\\nladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the\\r\\npower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and\\r\\nconceited.', 'They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the\\r\\nfirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand\\r\\npounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of\\r\\nassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect\\r\\nentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others.', \"They were of\\r\\na respectable family in the north of England;

then\\r\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\r\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\r\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\r\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.', \"This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;

walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\\r\\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\\r\\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.', 'Uncle Henry\\r\\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\\r\\nanother corner.', 'There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a\\r\\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a

the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\\r\\nhole.', 'When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\\r\\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side.',

house\\r\\nhad been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed\\r\\nit away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.', 'When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.', 'The sun\\r\\nand wind had changed her, too.', 'They had taken the sparkle from her\\r\\neyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks\\r\\nand lips,

what the future would bring.', 'At last she\\r\\ncrawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and lay down upon it; and\\r\\nToto followed and lay down beside her.', 'In spite of the swaying of the

about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious\\r\\nfruits.', 'Banks of gorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with\\r\\nrare and brilliant plumage sang and fluttered in the trees and bushes.', 'A little way off was a small brook, rushing and sparkling along between\\r\\ngreen banks, and murmuring in a voice very grateful to a little girl\\r\\nwho had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.', 'While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights,\\r\\nshe noticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had\\r\\never seen.', 'They were not as big as

were, so far as looks go, many years older.', 'Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed.', 'They wore\\r\\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\\r\\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved.', \"The\\r\\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\\r\\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders.\", 'Over it were\\r\\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds.', 'The\\r\\nmen were dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\\r\\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops.', 'The men,\\r\\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\\r\\nbeards.', 'But the little woman was doubtless much older.', 'Her face was\\r\\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\\r\\nstiffly.', 'When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\\r\\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\\r\\ncome farther.', 'But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a\\r\\nlow bow and said, in a sweet voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.', 'We are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\\r\\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"', 'Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder.', 'What could the little\\r\\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\\r\\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East?', 'Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\\r\\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\\r\\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.', 'But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\\r\\nwith hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake.', 'I\\r\\nhave not killed anything.\"', '\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\\r\\n\"and that is the same thing.', 'See!\"', 'she continued, pointing to the\\r\\ncorner of the house.', '\"There are her two feet, still sticking out from\\r\\nunder a block of wood.\"', 'Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright.', 'There, indeed, just\\r\\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\\r\\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.', '\"Oh, dear!', 'Oh, dear!\"', 'cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\\r\\ndismay.', '\"The house must have fallen on her.', 'Whatever shall we do?\"', '\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.', '\"But who was she?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little\\r\\nwoman.', '\"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\\r\\nmaking them slave for her night and day.', 'Now they are all set free,\\r\\nand are grateful to you for the favor.\"', '\"Who are the Munchkins?\"', 'inquired Dorothy.', '\"They are the people who live in this land of the East\\r\\n where the Wicked Witch ruled.\"', '\"Are you a Munchkin?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.', 'When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\\r\\nmessenger to me, and I came at once.', 'I am the Witch of the North.\"', '\"Oh, gracious!\"', 'cried Dorothy.', '\"Are you a real witch?\"', '\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the little woman.', '\"But I am a good witch, and\\r\\nthe people love me.', 'I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\\r\\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\"', '\"But I thought all witches were wicked,\" said the girl, who was half\\r\\nfrightened at facing a real witch.', '\"Oh, no, that is a great mistake.', 'There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,\\r\\nthose who live in the North and the South, are good witches.', 'I know\\r\\nthis is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.', 'Those who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;\\r\\nbut now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch\\r\\nin all the Land of Oz--the one who lives in the West.\"', '\"But,\" said Dorothy, after a moment\\'s thought, \"Aunt Em has told me\\r\\nthat the witches were all dead--years and years ago.\"', '\"Who is Aunt Em?\"', 'inquired the little old woman.', '\"She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.\"', 'The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed\\r\\nand her eyes upon the ground.', 'Then she looked up and said, \"I do not\\r\\nknow where Kansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned\\r\\nbefore.', 'But tell me, is it a civilized country?\"', '\"Oh, yes,\" replied Dorothy.', '\"Then that accounts for it.', 'In the civilized countries I believe there\\r\\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians.', 'But,\\r\\nyou see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off\\r\\nfrom all the rest of the world.', 'Therefore we still have witches and\\r\\nwizards amongst us.\"', '\"Who are the wizards?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"Oz himself is the Great Wizard,\" answered the Witch, sinking her voice\\r\\nto a whisper.', '\"He is more powerful than all the rest of us together.', 'He lives in the City of Emeralds.\"', 'Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins,\\r\\nwho had been standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the\\r\\ncorner of the house where the Wicked Witch had been lying.', '\"What is it?\"', 'asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\\r\\nlaugh.', 'The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and\\r\\nnothing was left but the silver shoes.', '\"She was so old,\" explained the Witch of the North, \"that she dried up\\r\\nquickly in the sun.', 'That is the end of her.', 'But the silver shoes are\\r\\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.\"', 'She reached down and picked up\\r\\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to\\r\\nDorothy.', '\"The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,\" said one of\\r\\nthe Munchkins, \"and there is some charm connected with them; but what\\r\\nit is we never knew.\"', 'Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table.', 'Then she came out again to the Munchkins and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\\r\\nworry about me.', 'Can you help me find my way?\"', 'The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at\\r\\nDorothy, and then shook their heads.', '\"At the East, not far from here,\" said one, \"there is a great desert,\\r\\nand none could live to cross it.\"', '\"It is the same at the South,\" said another, \"for I have been there and\\r\\nseen it.', 'The South is the country of the Quadlings.\"', '\"I am told,\" said the third man, \"that it is the same at the West.', 'And\\r\\nthat country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of\\r\\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.\"', '\"The North is my home,\" said the old lady, \"and at its edge is the same\\r\\ngreat desert that surrounds this Land of Oz.', 'I\\'m afraid, my dear, you\\r\\nwill have to live with us.\"', 'Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these\\r\\nstrange people.', 'Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins,\\r\\nfor they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep\\r\\nalso.', 'As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced\\r\\nthe point on the end of her nose, while she counted \"One, two, three\"\\r\\nin a solemn voice.', 'At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\\r\\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\\r\\nwords on it, asked, \"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\"', '\"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.', '\"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds.', 'Perhaps Oz will help you.\"', '\"Where is this city?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\\r\\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\"', '\"Is he a good man?\"', 'inquired the girl anxiously.', '\"He is a good Wizard.', 'Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\\r\\nhave never seen him.\"', '\"How can I get there?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"You must walk.', 'It is a long journey, through a country that is\\r\\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible.', 'However, I will\\r\\nuse all the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\"', '\"Won\\'t you go with me?\"', 'pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\\r\\nthe little old woman as her only friend.', '\"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied, \"but I will give you my kiss, and\\r\\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\\r\\nthe North.\"', 'She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead.', 'Where\\r\\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\\r\\nfound out soon after.', '\"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the\\r\\nWitch, \"so you cannot miss it.', 'When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\\r\\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you.', 'Good-bye, my dear.\"', 'The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\\r\\nafter which they walked away through the trees.', 'The Witch gave Dorothy\\r\\na friendly little nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and\\r\\nstraightway disappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who\\r\\nbarked after her loudly enough when she had gone, because he had been\\r\\nafraid even to growl while she stood by.', 'But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear\\r\\nin just that way, and was not surprised in the least.', '3.', 'How Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry.', 'So she went to\\r\\nthe cupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter.', 'She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it\\r\\ndown to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water.', 'Toto ran over to the trees and began to bark at the birds sitting\\r\\nthere.', 'Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\\r\\nfrom the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\\r\\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.', 'Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\\r\\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\\r\\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.', 'Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\\r\\nhanging on a peg beside her bed.', 'It was gingham, with checks of white\\r\\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\\r\\nit was still a pretty frock.', 'The girl washed herself carefully,\\r\\ndressed herself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on\\r\\nher head.', 'She took a little basket and filled it with bread from the\\r\\ncupboard, laying a white cloth over the top.', 'Then she looked down at\\r\\nher feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.', '\"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\" she said.', 'And\\r\\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\\r\\ntail to show he knew what she meant.', 'At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\\r\\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.', '\"I wonder if they will fit me,\" she said to Toto.', '\"They would be just\\r\\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\"', 'She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\\r\\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.', 'Finally she picked up her basket.', '\"Come along, Toto,\" she said.', '\"We will go to the Emerald City and ask\\r\\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\"', 'She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\\r\\nof her dress.', 'And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she\\r\\nstarted on her journey.', 'There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find\\r\\nthe one paved with yellow bricks.', 'Within a short time she was walking\\r\\nbriskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on\\r\\nthe hard, yellow road-bed.', 'The sun shone bright and the birds sang\\r\\nsweetly, and Dorothy did not feel nearly so bad as you might think a\\r\\nlittle girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own\\r\\ncountry and set down in the midst of a strange land.', 'She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country\\r\\nwas about her.', 'There were neat fences at the sides of the road,\\r\\npainted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and\\r\\nvegetables in abundance.', 'Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and\\r\\nable to raise large crops.', 'Once in a while she would pass a house, and\\r\\nthe people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by; for\\r\\neveryone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and\\r\\nsetting them free from bondage.', 'The houses of the Munchkins were\\r\\nodd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a roof.', 'All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\\r\\nfavorite color.', 'Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to\\r\\nwonder where she should pass the night, she came to a house rather\\r\\nlarger than the rest.', 'On the green lawn before it many men and women\\r\\nwere dancing.', 'Five little fiddlers played as loudly as possible, and\\r\\nthe people were laughing and singing, while a big table near by was\\r\\nloaded with delicious fruits and nuts, pies and cakes, and many other\\r\\ngood things to eat.', 'The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to\\r\\npass the night with them; for this was the home of one of the richest\\r\\nMunchkins in the land, and his friends were gathered with him to\\r\\ncelebrate their freedom from the bondage of the Wicked Witch.', 'Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin\\r\\nhimself, whose name was Boq.', 'Then she sat upon a settee and watched\\r\\nthe people dance.', 'When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \"You must be a great sorceress.\"', '\"Why?\"', 'asked the girl.', '\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.', 'Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\\r\\nwear white.\"', '\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\\r\\nwrinkles in it.', '\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq.', '\"Blue is the color of the\\r\\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color.', 'So we know you are a friendly\\r\\nwitch.\"', 'Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\\r\\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\\r\\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.', 'When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\\r\\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it.', 'The sheets were made\\r\\nof blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with\\r\\nToto curled up on the blue rug beside her.', 'She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played\\r\\nwith Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that\\r\\ngreatly amused Dorothy.', 'Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people,\\r\\nfor they had never seen a dog before.', '\"How far is it to the Emerald City?\"', 'the girl asked.', '\"I do not know,\" answered Boq gravely, \"for I have never been there.', 'It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business\\r\\nwith him.', 'But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take\\r\\nyou many days.', 'The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must\\r\\npass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of\\r\\nyour journey.\"', 'This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz\\r\\ncould help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn\\r\\nback.', 'She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of\\r\\nyellow brick.', 'When she had gone several miles she thought she would\\r\\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\\r\\nand sat down.', 'There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not\\r\\nfar away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds\\r\\nfrom the ripe corn.', 'Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\\r\\nScarecrow.', 'Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\\r\\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face.', 'An old, pointed\\r\\nblue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head,\\r\\nand the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\\r\\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw.', 'On the feet were some old\\r\\nboots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the\\r\\nfigure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck\\r\\nup its back.', 'While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\\r\\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.', 'She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\\r\\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\\r\\nhead to her in a friendly way.', 'Then she climbed down from the fence\\r\\nand walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.', '\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.', '\"Did you speak?\"', 'asked the girl, in wonder.', '\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow.', '\"How do you do?\"', '\"I\\'m pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy politely.', '\"How do you\\r\\ndo?\"', '\"I\\'m not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\\r\\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"', '\"Can\\'t you get down?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back.', 'If you will please take away\\r\\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"', 'Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\\r\\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.', '\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\\r\\nthe ground.', '\"I feel like a new man.\"', 'Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\\r\\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.', '\"Who are you?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\\r\\nyawned.', '\"And where are you going?\"', '\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\\r\\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"', '\"Where is the Emerald City?\"', 'he inquired.', '\"And who is Oz?\"', '\"Why, don\\'t you know?\"', 'she returned, in surprise.', '\"No, indeed.', \"I don't know anything.\", 'You see, I am stuffed, so I have\\r\\nno brains at all,\" he answered sadly.', '\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, \"I\\'m awfully sorry for you.\"', '\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\\r\\nOz would give me some brains?\"', '\"I cannot tell,\" she returned, \"but you may come with me, if you like.', 'If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\\r\\nare now.\"', '\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"You see,\" he continued\\r\\nconfidentially, \"I don\\'t mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\\r\\nbecause I cannot get hurt.', \"If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\\r\\ninto me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it.\", 'But I do not want\\r\\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\\r\\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"', '\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly sorry\\r\\nfor him.', '\"If you will come with me I\\'ll ask Oz to do all he can for\\r\\nyou.\"', '\"Thank you,\" he answered gratefully.', 'They walked back to the road.', 'Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\\r\\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.', 'Toto did not like this addition to the party at first.', 'He smelled\\r\\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\\r\\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\\r\\nScarecrow.', '\"Don\\'t mind Toto,\" said Dorothy to her new friend.', '\"He never bites.\"', '\"Oh, I\\'m not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow.', '\"He can\\'t hurt the straw.', 'Do let me carry that basket for you.', \"I shall not mind it, for I can't\\r\\nget tired.\", 'I\\'ll tell you a secret,\" he continued, as he walked along.', '\"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\"', '\"What is that?\"', 'asked Dorothy; \"the Munchkin farmer who made you?\"', '\"No,\" answered the Scarecrow; \"it\\'s a lighted match.\"', '4.', 'The Road Through the Forest\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so\\r\\ndifficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks,\\r\\nwhich were here very uneven.', 'Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or\\r\\nmissing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy\\r\\nwalked around.', 'As for the Scarecrow, having no brains, he walked\\r\\nstraight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and fell at full length\\r\\non the hard bricks.', 'It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick\\r\\nhim up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in laughing\\r\\nmerrily at his own mishap.', 'The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther\\r\\nback.', 'There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther\\r\\nthey went the more dismal and lonesome the country became.', 'At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy\\r\\nopened her basket and got out some bread.', 'She offered a piece to the\\r\\nScarecrow, but he refused.', '\"I am never hungry,\" he said, \"and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my\\r\\nmouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could eat,\\r\\nthe straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the\\r\\nshape of my head.\"', 'Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on\\r\\neating her bread.', '\"Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,\" said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner.', 'So she told him all\\r\\nabout Kansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone\\r\\nhad carried her to this queer Land of Oz.', 'The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, \"I cannot understand why\\r\\nyou should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry,\\r\\ngray place you call Kansas.\"', '\"That is because you have no brains\" answered the girl.', '\"No matter how\\r\\ndreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\\r\\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful.', 'There is no place like home.\"', 'The Scarecrow sighed.', '\"Of course I cannot understand it,\" he said.', '\"If your heads were\\r\\nstuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\\r\\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all.', 'It is\\r\\nfortunate for Kansas that you have brains.\"', '\"Won\\'t you tell me a story, while we are resting?\"', 'asked the child.', 'The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever.', 'I was\\r\\nonly made day before yesterday.', 'What happened in the world before that\\r\\ntime is all unknown to me.', 'Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\\r\\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\\r\\nwas going on.', \"There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\\r\\nI heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'\", '\"\\'They aren\\'t straight,\\'\" answered the other.', '\"\\'Never mind,\\'\" said the farmer.', '\"\\'They are ears just the same,\\'\"\\r\\nwhich was true enough.', '\"\\'Now I\\'ll make the eyes,\\'\" said the farmer.', 'So he painted my right\\r\\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\\r\\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\\r\\nfirst glimpse of the world.', '\"\\'That\\'s a rather pretty eye,\\'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\\r\\nthe farmer.', '\"\\'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.\\'', '\"\\'I think I\\'ll make the other a little bigger,\\'\" said the farmer.', 'And\\r\\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before.', 'Then\\r\\nhe made my nose and my mouth.', \"But I did not speak, because at that\\r\\ntime I didn't know what a mouth was for.\", 'I had the fun of watching\\r\\nthem make my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my\\r\\nhead, at last, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a\\r\\nman as anyone.', '\"\\'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,\\' said the farmer.', \"'He\\r\\nlooks just like a man.'\", '\"\\'Why, he is a man,\\' said the other, and I quite agreed with him.', 'The\\r\\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\r\\ntall stick, where you found me.', 'He and his friend soon after walked\\r\\naway and left me alone.', '\"I did not like to be deserted this way.', 'So I tried to walk after\\r\\nthem.', 'But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay\\r\\non that pole.', 'It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think\\r\\nof, having been made such a little while before.', 'Many crows and other\\r\\nbirds flew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew\\r\\naway again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me\\r\\nfeel that I was quite an important person.', 'By and by an old crow flew\\r\\nnear me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.', \"Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.'\", 'Then he hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted.', 'The\\r\\nother birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too,\\r\\nso in a short time there was a great flock of them about me.', '\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\\r\\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, \\'If you only had\\r\\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\\r\\nbetter man than some of them.', \"Brains are the only things worth having\\r\\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'\", '\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\\r\\nhard to get some brains.', 'By good luck you came along and pulled me off\\r\\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\\r\\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"', '\"I hope so,\" said Dorothy earnestly, \"since you seem anxious to have\\r\\nthem.\"', '\"Oh, yes; I am anxious,\" returned the Scarecrow.', '\"It is such an\\r\\nuncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.\"', '\"Well,\" said the girl, \"let us go.\"', 'And she handed the basket to the\\r\\nScarecrow.', 'There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough\\r\\nand untilled.', 'Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the\\r\\ntrees grew so big and close together that their branches met over the\\r\\nroad of yellow brick.', 'It was almost dark under the trees, for the\\r\\nbranches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop, and\\r\\nwent on into the forest.', '\"If this road goes in, it must come out,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and as\\r\\nthe Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever\\r\\nit leads us.\"', '\"Anyone would know that,\" said Dorothy.', '\"Certainly; that is why I know it,\" returned the Scarecrow.', '\"If it\\r\\nrequired brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.\"', 'After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves\\r\\nstumbling along in the darkness.', 'Dorothy could not see at all, but\\r\\nToto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow\\r\\ndeclared he could see as well as by day.', 'So she took hold of his arm\\r\\nand managed to get along fairly well.', '\"If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,\" she\\r\\nsaid, \"you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the\\r\\ndark.\"', 'Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.', '\"I see a little cottage at the right of us,\" he said, \"built of logs\\r\\nand branches.', 'Shall we go there?\"', '\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the child.', '\"I am all tired out.\"', 'So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the\\r\\ncottage, and Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one\\r\\ncorner.', 'She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her soon fell into\\r\\na sound sleep.', 'The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood up in another\\r\\ncorner and waited patiently until morning came.', '5.', 'The Rescue of the Tin Woodman\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had\\r\\nlong been out chasing birds around him and squirrels.', 'She sat up and\\r\\nlooked around her.', 'There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner,\\r\\nwaiting for her.', '\"We must go and search for water,\" she said to him.', '\"Why do you want water?\"', 'he asked.', '\"To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the\\r\\ndry bread will not stick in my throat.\"', '\"It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,\" said the Scarecrow\\r\\nthoughtfully, \"for you must sleep, and eat and drink.', 'However, you\\r\\nhave brains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think\\r\\nproperly.\"', 'They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a\\r\\nlittle spring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate\\r\\nher breakfast.', 'She saw there was not much bread left in the basket,\\r\\nand the girl was thankful the Scarecrow did not have to eat anything,\\r\\nfor there was scarcely enough for herself and Toto for the day.', 'When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of\\r\\nyellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.', '\"What was that?\"', 'she asked timidly.', '\"I cannot imagine,\" replied the Scarecrow; \"but we can go and see.\"', 'Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to\\r\\ncome from behind them.', 'They turned and walked through the forest a few\\r\\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\\r\\nthat fell between the trees.', 'She ran to the place and then stopped\\r\\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.', 'One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\\r\\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\\r\\nof tin.', 'His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\\r\\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.', 'Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\\r\\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\\r\\nteeth.', '\"Did you groan?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"Yes,\" answered the tin man, \"I did.', 'I\\'ve been groaning for more than\\r\\na year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\"', '\"What can I do for you?\"', 'she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\\r\\nsad voice in which the man spoke.', '\"Get an oil-can and oil my joints,\" he answered.', '\"They are rusted so\\r\\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\\r\\nbe all right again.', 'You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\"', 'Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\\r\\nshe returned and asked anxiously, \"Where are your joints?\"', '\"Oil my neck, first,\" replied the Tin Woodman.', 'So she oiled it, and as\\r\\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\\r\\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\\r\\nman could turn it himself.', '\"Now oil the joints in my arms,\" he said.', 'And Dorothy oiled them and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\\r\\nand as good as new.', 'The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\\r\\nhe leaned against the tree.', '\"This is a great comfort,\" he said.', '\"I have been holding that axe in\\r\\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I\\'m glad to be able to put it down at\\r\\nlast.', 'Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\\r\\nonce more.\"', 'So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\\r\\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\\r\\ncreature, and very grateful.', '\"I might have stood there always if you had not come along,\" he said;\\r\\n\"so you have certainly saved my life.', 'How did you happen to be here?\"', '\"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,\" she\\r\\nanswered, \"and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\"', '\"Why do you wish to see Oz?\"', 'he asked.', '\"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\\r\\nput a few brains into his head,\" she replied.', 'The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment.', 'Then he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\"', '\"Why, I guess so,\" Dorothy answered.', '\"It would be as easy as to give\\r\\nthe Scarecrow brains.\"', '\"True,\" the Tin Woodman returned.', '\"So, if you will allow me to join\\r\\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\"', '\"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\\r\\nwould be pleased to have his company.', 'So the Tin Woodman shouldered\\r\\nhis axe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the\\r\\nroad that was paved with yellow brick.', 'The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.', '\"For,\" he said, \"if I should get caught in the rain, and rust again, I\\r\\nwould need the oil-can badly.\"', 'It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for\\r\\nsoon after they had begun their journey again they came to a place\\r\\nwhere the trees and branches grew so thick over the road that the\\r\\ntravelers could not pass.', 'But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\\r\\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party.', 'Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\\r\\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\\r\\nside of the road.', 'Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\\r\\nagain.', '\"Why didn\\'t you walk around the hole?\"', 'asked the Tin Woodman.', '\"I don\\'t know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully.', '\"My head is\\r\\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\\r\\nhim for some brains.\"', '\"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"But, after all, brains are not the\\r\\nbest things in the world.\"', '\"Have you any?\"', 'inquired the Scarecrow.', '\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman.', '\"But once I had\\r\\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\\r\\nrather have a heart.\"', '\"And why is that?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow.', '\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"', 'So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\\r\\nthe following story:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\\r\\nand sold the wood for a living.', 'When I grew up, I too became a\\r\\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\\r\\nlong as she lived.', 'Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\\r\\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.', '\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\\r\\ngrew to love her with all my heart.', 'She, on her part, promised to\\r\\nmarry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house\\r\\nfor her; so I set to work harder than ever.', 'But the girl lived with an\\r\\nold woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\\r\\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\\r\\nhousework.', 'So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\\r\\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.', 'Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\\r\\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\\r\\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\\r\\nleft leg.', '\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\r\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper.', 'So I went to a tinsmith and\\r\\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin.', 'The leg worked very well, once I\\r\\nwas used to it.', 'But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East,\\r\\nfor she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty\\r\\nMunchkin girl.', 'When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off\\r\\nmy right leg.', 'Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg\\r\\nout of tin.', 'After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after\\r\\nthe other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones.', 'The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at\\r\\nfirst I thought that was the end of me.', 'But the tinsmith happened to\\r\\ncome along, and he made me a new head out of tin.', '\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\r\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be.', 'She thought of a\\r\\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\\r\\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\\r\\ntwo halves.', 'Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\\r\\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\\r\\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever.', 'But, alas!', 'I had\\r\\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\\r\\nnot care whether I married her or not.', 'I suppose she is still living\\r\\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.', '\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\\r\\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me.', 'There was only one danger--that my joints would rust; but I kept an\\r\\noil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it.', 'However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught\\r\\nin a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted,\\r\\nand I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me.', 'It was\\r\\na terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had\\r\\ntime to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my\\r\\nheart.', 'While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one\\r\\ncan love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\\r\\none.', 'If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"', 'Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\\r\\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\\r\\nnew heart.', '\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead of\\r\\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\\r\\none.\"', '\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do not\\r\\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"', 'Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\\r\\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\\r\\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\\r\\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.', 'What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another\\r\\nmeal for herself and Toto would empty the basket.', 'To be sure, neither\\r\\nthe Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made\\r\\nof tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.', '6.', 'The Cowardly Lion\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the\\r\\nthick woods.', 'The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these\\r\\nwere much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and\\r\\nthe walking was not at all good.', 'There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the\\r\\nopen country where there is plenty of sunshine.', 'But now and then there\\r\\ncame a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees.', \"These\\r\\nsounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know\\r\\nwhat made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side,\\r\\nand did not even bark in return.\", '\"How long will it be,\" the child asked of the Tin Woodman, \"before we\\r\\nare out of the forest?\"', '\"I cannot tell,\" was the answer, \"for I have never been to the Emerald\\r\\nCity.', 'But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it\\r\\nwas a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the\\r\\ncity where Oz dwells the country is beautiful.', 'But I am not afraid so\\r\\nlong as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while\\r\\nyou bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch\\'s kiss, and that\\r\\nwill protect you from harm.\"', '\"But Toto!\"', 'said the girl anxiously.', '\"What will protect him?\"', '\"We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,\" replied the Tin\\r\\nWoodman.', 'Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\\r\\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road.', 'With one blow of his\\r\\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\\r\\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws.', \"But,\\r\\nto the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\\r\\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\", 'Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\\r\\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when\\r\\nDorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed\\r\\nforward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while\\r\\nshe cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t you dare to bite Toto!', 'You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a\\r\\nbig beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!\"', '\"I didn\\'t bite him,\" said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw\\r\\nwhere Dorothy had hit it.', '\"No, but you tried to,\" she retorted.', '\"You are nothing but a big\\r\\ncoward.\"', '\"I know it,\" said the Lion, hanging his head in shame.', '\"I\\'ve always\\r\\nknown it.', 'But how can I help it?\"', '\"I don\\'t know, I\\'m sure.', 'To think of your striking a stuffed man, like\\r\\nthe poor Scarecrow!\"', '\"Is he stuffed?\"', 'asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up\\r\\nthe Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\\r\\nshape again.', '\"Of course he\\'s stuffed,\" replied Dorothy, who was still angry.', '\"That\\'s why he went over so easily,\" remarked the Lion.', '\"It astonished\\r\\nme to see him whirl around so.', 'Is the other one stuffed also?\"', '\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"he\\'s made of tin.\"', 'And she helped the Woodman up\\r\\nagain.', '\"That\\'s why he nearly blunted my claws,\" said the Lion.', '\"When they\\r\\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back.', 'What\\r\\nis that little animal you are so tender of?\"', '\"He is my dog, Toto,\" answered Dorothy.', '\"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?\"', 'asked the Lion.', '\"Neither.', 'He\\'s a--a--a meat dog,\" said the girl.', '\"Oh!', \"He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look\\r\\nat him.\", 'No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a\\r\\ncoward like me,\" continued the Lion sadly.', '\"What makes you a coward?\"', 'asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in\\r\\nwonder, for he was as big as a small horse.', '\"It\\'s a mystery,\" replied the Lion.', '\"I suppose I was born that way.', 'All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave,\\r\\nfor the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts.', 'I learned\\r\\nthat if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got\\r\\nout of my way.', \"Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I\\r\\njust roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go.\", 'If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight\\r\\nme, I should have run myself--I\\'m such a coward; but just as soon as\\r\\nthey hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let\\r\\nthem go.\"', '\"But that isn\\'t right.', 'The King of Beasts shouldn\\'t be a coward,\" said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow.', '\"I know it,\" returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip\\r\\nof his tail.', '\"It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.', 'But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.\"', '\"Perhaps you have heart disease,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"It may be,\" said the Lion.', '\"If you have,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"you ought to be glad, for it\\r\\nproves you have a heart.', 'For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot\\r\\nhave heart disease.\"', '\"Perhaps,\" said the Lion thoughtfully, \"if I had no heart I should not\\r\\nbe a coward.\"', '\"Have you brains?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow.', '\"I suppose so.', 'I\\'ve never looked to see,\" replied the Lion.', '\"I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,\" remarked the\\r\\nScarecrow, \"for my head is stuffed with straw.\"', '\"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\" said the Woodman.', '\"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\" added\\r\\nDorothy.', '\"Do you think Oz could give me courage?\"', 'asked the Cowardly Lion.', '\"Just as easily as he could give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"Or give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"Or send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.', '\"Then, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll go with you,\" said the Lion, \"for my\\r\\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\"', '\"You will be very welcome,\" answered Dorothy, \"for you will help to\\r\\nkeep away the other wild beasts.', 'It seems to me they must be more\\r\\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\"', '\"They really are,\" said the Lion, \"but that doesn\\'t make me any braver,\\r\\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\"', \"So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion\\r\\nwalking with stately strides at Dorothy's side.\", \"Toto did not approve of\\r\\nthis new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had\\r\\nbeen crushed between the Lion's great jaws.\", 'But after a time he became\\r\\nmore at ease, and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be\\r\\ngood friends.', 'During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the\\r\\npeace of their journey.', 'Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a\\r\\nbeetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little\\r\\nthing.', 'This made the Tin Woodman very unhappy, for he was always\\r\\ncareful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept\\r\\nseveral tears of sorrow and regret.', 'These tears ran slowly down his\\r\\nface and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted.', 'When\\r\\nDorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could not open\\r\\nhis mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together.', 'He became\\r\\ngreatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve\\r\\nhim, but she could not understand.', 'The Lion was also puzzled to know\\r\\nwhat was wrong.', \"But the Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy's\\r\\nbasket and oiled the Woodman's jaws, so that after a few moments he\\r\\ncould talk as well as before.\", '\"This will serve me a lesson,\" said he, \"to look where I step.', 'For if\\r\\nI should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and\\r\\ncrying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.\"', 'Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and\\r\\nwhen he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to\\r\\nharm it.', 'The Tin Woodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore\\r\\nhe took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.', '\"You people with hearts,\" he said, \"have something to guide you, and\\r\\nneed never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\\r\\ncareful.', 'When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn\\'t mind so much.\"', '7.', 'The Journey to the Great Oz\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the\\r\\nforest, for there were no houses near.', 'The tree made a good, thick\\r\\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\\r\\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\\r\\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely.', 'She and Toto ate the last of\\r\\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.', '\"If you wish,\" said the Lion, \"I will go into the forest and kill a\\r\\ndeer for you.', 'You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\\r\\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\\r\\ngood breakfast.\"', '\"Don\\'t!', 'Please don\\'t,\" begged the Tin Woodman.', '\"I should certainly\\r\\nweep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\"', \"But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\\r\\none ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it.\", \"And the Scarecrow\\r\\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\\r\\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time.\", 'She thought this was\\r\\nvery kind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at\\r\\nthe awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts.', 'His\\r\\npadded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped\\r\\nalmost as many as he put in the basket.', 'But the Scarecrow did not mind\\r\\nhow long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep\\r\\naway from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and\\r\\nburn him up.', 'So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only\\r\\ncame near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.', 'These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.', 'When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling\\r\\nbrook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.', 'This was to be an eventful day for the travelers.', 'They had hardly been\\r\\nwalking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed\\r\\nthe road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either\\r\\nside.', 'It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and\\r\\nlooked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were\\r\\nmany big, jagged rocks at the bottom.', 'The sides were so steep that\\r\\nnone of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their\\r\\njourney must end.', '\"What shall we do?\"', 'asked Dorothy despairingly.', '\"I haven\\'t the faintest idea,\" said the Tin Woodman, and the Lion shook\\r\\nhis shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.', 'But the Scarecrow said, \"We cannot fly, that is certain.', 'Neither can\\r\\nwe climb down into this great ditch.', 'Therefore, if we cannot jump over\\r\\nit, we must stop where we are.\"', '\"I think I could jump over it,\" said the Cowardly Lion, after measuring\\r\\nthe distance carefully in his mind.', '\"Then we are all right,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"for you can carry us\\r\\nall over on your back, one at a time.\"', '\"Well, I\\'ll try it,\" said the Lion.', '\"Who will go first?\"', '\"I will,\" declared the Scarecrow, \"for, if you found that you could not\\r\\njump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly\\r\\ndented on the rocks below.', 'But if I am on your back it will not matter\\r\\nso much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.\"', '\"I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,\" said the Cowardly Lion, \"but\\r\\nI suppose there is nothing to do but try it.', 'So get on my back and we\\r\\nwill make the attempt.\"', \"The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion's back, and the big beast walked to the\\r\\nedge of the gulf and crouched down.\", '\"Why don\\'t you run and jump?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow.', '\"Because that isn\\'t the way we Lions do these things,\" he replied.', 'Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely\\r\\non the other side.', 'They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he\\r\\ndid it, and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion\\r\\nsprang across the ditch again.', \"Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and\\r\\nclimbed on the Lion's back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand.\", 'The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and\\r\\nthen, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other\\r\\nside.', 'The Lion went back a third time and got the Tin Woodman, and\\r\\nthen they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to\\r\\nrest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like\\r\\na big dog that has been running too long.', 'They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and\\r\\ngloomy.', 'After the Lion had rested they started along the road of\\r\\nyellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they\\r\\nwould come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again.', 'To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the\\r\\ndepths of the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in\\r\\nthis part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.', '\"What are the Kalidahs?\"', 'asked the girl.', '\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\r\\ntigers,\" replied the Lion, \"and with claws so long and sharp that they\\r\\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto.', 'I\\'m terribly\\r\\nafraid of the Kalidahs.\"', '\"I\\'m not surprised that you are,\" returned Dorothy.', '\"They must be\\r\\ndreadful beasts.\"', 'The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\\r\\nacross the road.', 'But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew\\r\\nat once he could not leap across it.', 'So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\\r\\nthought the Scarecrow said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch.', 'If the Tin Woodman\\r\\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\\r\\nacross it easily.\"', '\"That is a first-rate idea,\" said the Lion.', '\"One would almost suspect\\r\\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"', 'The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\\r\\nwas soon chopped nearly through.', 'Then the Lion put his strong front\\r\\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\\r\\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\\r\\nbranches on the other side.', 'They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\\r\\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\\r\\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.', '\"They are the Kalidahs!\"', 'said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.', '\"Quick!\"', 'cried the Scarecrow.', '\"Let us cross over.\"', 'So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\\r\\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next.', 'The Lion, although he was\\r\\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\\r\\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\\r\\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\\r\\nin surprise.', 'But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\\r\\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\\r\\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\\r\\nwould do next.', 'Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also\\r\\nbegan to cross the tree.', 'And the Lion said to Dorothy:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\r\\nclaws.', 'But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I\\r\\nam alive.\"', '\"Wait a minute!\"', 'called the Scarecrow.', 'He had been thinking what was\\r\\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\\r\\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch.', 'The Tin Woodman began\\r\\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\\r\\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\\r\\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\\r\\nrocks at the bottom.', '\"Well,\" said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief, \"I see\\r\\nwe are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it\\r\\nmust be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive.', 'Those creatures\\r\\nfrightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.\"', '\"Ah,\" said the Tin Woodman sadly, \"I wish I had a heart to beat.\"', \"This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of\\r\\nthe forest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had\\r\\nto ride on the Lion's back.\", 'To their great joy the trees became\\r\\nthinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly\\r\\ncame upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them.', 'On the\\r\\nother side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running\\r\\nthrough a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright\\r\\nflowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious\\r\\nfruits.', 'They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country\\r\\nbefore them.', '\"How shall we cross the river?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"That is easily done,\" replied the Scarecrow.', '\"The Tin Woodman must\\r\\nbuild us a raft, so we can float to the other side.\"', 'So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make\\r\\na raft, and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the\\r\\nriverbank a tree full of fine fruit.', 'This pleased Dorothy, who had\\r\\neaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe\\r\\nfruit.', 'But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and\\r\\nuntiring as the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done.', 'So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until\\r\\nthe morning; and Dorothy dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good\\r\\nWizard Oz, who would soon send her back to her own home again.', '8.', 'The Deadly Poppy Field\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and\\r\\nfull of hope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and\\r\\nplums from the trees beside the river.', 'Behind them was the dark forest\\r\\nthey had passed safely through, although they had suffered many\\r\\ndiscouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that\\r\\nseemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.', 'To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land.', 'But the raft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few\\r\\nmore logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready\\r\\nto start.', 'Dorothy sat down in the middle of the raft and held Toto in\\r\\nher arms.', 'When the Cowardly Lion stepped upon the raft it tipped\\r\\nbadly, for he was big and heavy; but the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman\\r\\nstood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their\\r\\nhands to push the raft through the water.', 'They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of\\r\\nthe river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and\\r\\nfarther away from the road of yellow brick.', 'And the water grew so deep\\r\\nthat the long poles would not touch the bottom.', '\"This is bad,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for if we cannot get to the land\\r\\nwe shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\\r\\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.\"', '\"And then I should get no brains,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"And I should get no courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.', '\"And I should get no heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"And I should never get back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.', '\"We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,\" the Scarecrow\\r\\ncontinued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in\\r\\nthe mud at the bottom of the river.', 'Then, before he could pull it out\\r\\nagain--or let go--the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was left\\r\\nclinging to the pole in the middle of the river.', '\"Good-bye!\"', 'he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\\r\\nhim.', \"Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered\\r\\nthat he might rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy's apron.\", 'Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.', '\"I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,\" he thought.', '\"Then,\\r\\nI was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare\\r\\nthe crows, at any rate.', 'But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow\\r\\nstuck on a pole in the middle of a river.', 'I am afraid I shall never\\r\\nhave any brains, after all!\"', 'Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far\\r\\nbehind.', 'Then the Lion said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Something must be done to save us.', 'I think I can swim to the shore\\r\\nand pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\\r\\ntail.\"', 'So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of\\r\\nhis tail.', 'Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the\\r\\nshore.', \"It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they\\r\\nwere drawn out of the current, and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman's\\r\\nlong pole and helped push the raft to the land.\", 'They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped\\r\\noff upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had\\r\\ncarried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the\\r\\nEmerald City.', '\"What shall we do now?\"', 'asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down on\\r\\nthe grass to let the sun dry him.', '\"We must get back to the road, in some way,\" said Dorothy.', '\"The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\\r\\nroad again,\" remarked the Lion.', 'So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they\\r\\nstarted along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had\\r\\ncarried them.', 'It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and\\r\\nfruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry\\r\\nfor the poor Scarecrow, they could have been very happy.', 'They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to\\r\\npick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\\r\\n\"Look!\"', 'Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon\\r\\nhis pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.', '\"What can we do to save him?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', 'The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know.', \"So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow\\r\\nuntil a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the\\r\\nwater's edge.\", '\"Who are you and where are you going?\"', 'asked the Stork.', '\"I am Dorothy,\" answered the girl, \"and these are my friends, the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and the Cowardly Lion;  and we are going to the Emerald City.\"', '\"This isn\\'t the road,\" said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and\\r\\nlooked sharply at the queer party.', '\"I know it,\" returned Dorothy, \"but we have lost the Scarecrow, and are\\r\\nwondering how we shall get him again.\"', '\"Where is he?\"', 'asked the Stork.', '\"Over there in the river,\" answered the little girl.', '\"If he wasn\\'t so big and heavy I would get him for you,\" remarked the\\r\\nStork.', '\"He isn\\'t heavy a bit,\" said Dorothy eagerly, \"for he is stuffed with\\r\\nstraw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever\\r\\nand ever so much.\"', '\"Well, I\\'ll try,\" said the Stork, \"but if I find he is too heavy to\\r\\ncarry I shall have to drop him in the river again.\"', 'So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to\\r\\nwhere the Scarecrow was perched upon his pole.', 'Then the Stork with her\\r\\ngreat claws grabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into\\r\\nthe air and back to the bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and Toto were sitting.', 'When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so\\r\\nhappy that he hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they\\r\\nwalked along he sang \"Tol-de-ri-de-oh!\"', 'at every step, he felt so gay.', '\"I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,\" he said,\\r\\n\"but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\\r\\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.\"', '\"That\\'s all right,\" said the Stork, who was flying along beside them.', '\"I always like to help anyone in trouble.', 'But I must go now, for my\\r\\nbabies are waiting in the nest for me.', 'I hope you will find the\\r\\nEmerald City and that Oz will help you.\"', '\"Thank you,\" replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the air\\r\\nand was soon out of sight.', 'They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored\\r\\nbirds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that\\r\\nthe ground was carpeted with them.', \"There were big yellow and white and\\r\\nblue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies,\\r\\nwhich were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Dorothy's eyes.\", '\"Aren\\'t they beautiful?\"', 'the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy\\r\\nscent of the bright flowers.', '\"I suppose so,\" answered the Scarecrow.', '\"When I have brains, I shall\\r\\nprobably like them better.\"', '\"If I only had a heart, I should love them,\" added the Tin Woodman.', '\"I always did like flowers,\" said the Lion.', '\"They seem so helpless\\r\\nand frail.', 'But there are none in the forest so bright as these.\"', 'They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer\\r\\nand fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the\\r\\nmidst of a great meadow of poppies.', 'Now it is well known that when\\r\\nthere are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that\\r\\nanyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried\\r\\naway from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever.', 'But\\r\\nDorothy did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red\\r\\nflowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy\\r\\nand she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.', 'But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.', '\"We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,\"\\r\\nhe said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him.', 'So they kept walking until\\r\\nDorothy could stand no longer.', 'Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\\r\\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.', '\"What shall we do?\"', 'asked the Tin Woodman.', '\"If we leave her here she will die,\" said the Lion.', '\"The smell of the\\r\\nflowers is killing us all.', 'I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open,\\r\\nand the dog is asleep already.\"', 'It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress.', 'But the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not\\r\\ntroubled by the scent of the flowers.', '\"Run fast,\" said the Scarecrow to the Lion, \"and get out of this deadly\\r\\nflower bed as soon as you can.', 'We will bring the little girl with us,\\r\\nbut if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.\"', 'So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go.', 'In a moment he was out of sight.', '\"Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,\" said the Scarecrow.', \"So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy's lap, and then they\\r\\nmade a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms\\r\\nand carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\", 'On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly\\r\\nflowers that surrounded them would never end.', 'They followed the bend\\r\\nof the river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast\\r\\nasleep among the poppies.', 'The flowers had been too strong for the huge\\r\\nbeast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance\\r\\nfrom the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in\\r\\nbeautiful green fields before them.', '\"We can do nothing for him,\" said the Tin Woodman, sadly; \"for he is\\r\\nmuch too heavy to lift.', 'We must leave him here to sleep on forever,\\r\\nand perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.\"', '\"I\\'m sorry,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"The Lion was a very good comrade for\\r\\none so cowardly.', 'But let us go on.\"', 'They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far\\r\\nenough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the\\r\\npoison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass\\r\\nand waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.', '9.', 'The Queen of the Field Mice\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,\" remarked the\\r\\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, \"for we have come nearly as far\\r\\nas the river carried us away.\"', 'The Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and\\r\\nturning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange\\r\\nbeast come bounding over the grass toward them.', 'It was, indeed, a\\r\\ngreat yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing\\r\\nsomething, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was\\r\\nwide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed\\r\\nlike balls of fire.', 'As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that running\\r\\nbefore the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no\\r\\nheart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a\\r\\npretty, harmless creature.', \"So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a\\r\\nquick blow that cut the beast's head clean off from its body, and it\\r\\nrolled over at his feet in two pieces.\", 'The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short;\\r\\nand coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, thank you!', 'Thank you ever so much for saving my life.\"', '\"Don\\'t speak of it, I beg of you,\" replied the Woodman.', '\"I have no\\r\\nheart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a\\r\\nfriend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.\"', '\"Only a mouse!\"', 'cried the little animal, indignantly.', '\"Why, I am a\\r\\nQueen--the Queen of all the Field Mice!\"', '\"Oh, indeed,\" said the Woodman, making a bow.', '\"Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in\\r\\nsaving my life,\" added the Queen.', 'At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their\\r\\nlittle legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen they\\r\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed!', 'How did you manage\\r\\nto escape the great Wildcat?\"', 'They all bowed so low to the little\\r\\nQueen that they almost stood upon their heads.', '\"This funny tin man,\" she answered, \"killed the Wildcat and saved my\\r\\nlife.', 'So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\\r\\nwish.\"', '\"We will!\"', 'cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus.', 'And then they\\r\\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and\\r\\nseeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped\\r\\nright into the middle of the group.', 'Toto had always loved to chase\\r\\nmice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.', 'But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight,\\r\\nwhile he called to the mice, \"Come back!', 'Come back!', 'Toto shall not\\r\\nhurt you.\"', 'At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a\\r\\nclump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, \"Are you sure he will not\\r\\nbite us?\"', '\"I will not let him,\" said the Woodman; \"so do not be afraid.\"', \"One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again,\\r\\nalthough he tried to get out of the Woodman's arms, and would have\\r\\nbitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin.\", 'Finally one\\r\\nof the biggest mice spoke.', '\"Is there anything we can do,\" it asked, \"to repay you for saving the\\r\\nlife of our Queen?\"', '\"Nothing that I know of,\" answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow, who\\r\\nhad been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed\\r\\nwith straw, said, quickly, \"Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the\\r\\nCowardly Lion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.\"', '\"A Lion!\"', 'cried the little Queen.', '\"Why, he would eat us all up.\"', '\"Oh, no,\" declared the Scarecrow; \"this Lion is a coward.\"', '\"Really?\"', 'asked the Mouse.', '\"He says so himself,\" answered the Scarecrow, \"and he would never hurt\\r\\nanyone who is our friend.', 'If you will help us to save him I promise\\r\\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.\"', '\"Very well,\" said the Queen, \"we trust you.', 'But what shall we do?\"', '\"Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\r\\nobey you?\"', '\"Oh, yes; there are thousands,\" she replied.', '\"Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\\r\\none bring a long piece of string.\"', 'The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at\\r\\nonce and get all her people.', 'As soon as they heard her orders they ran\\r\\naway in every direction as fast as possible.', '\"Now,\" said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, \"you must go to those\\r\\ntrees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.\"', 'So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon\\r\\nmade a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all\\r\\nthe leaves and branches.', 'He fastened it together with wooden pegs and\\r\\nmade the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk.', 'So fast\\r\\nand so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the\\r\\ntruck was all ready for them.', 'They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big\\r\\nmice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a\\r\\npiece of string in his mouth.', 'It was about this time that Dorothy woke\\r\\nfrom her long sleep and opened her eyes.', 'She was greatly astonished to\\r\\nfind herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing\\r\\naround and looking at her timidly.', 'But the Scarecrow told her about\\r\\neverything, and turning to the dignified little Mouse, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.\"', 'Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she\\r\\nbecame quite friendly with the little girl.', 'The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the\\r\\ntruck, using the strings they had brought.', 'One end of a string was\\r\\ntied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck.', 'Of\\r\\ncourse the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who\\r\\nwere to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were\\r\\nable to pull it quite easily.', 'Even the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman\\r\\ncould sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to\\r\\nthe place where the Lion lay asleep.', 'After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed\\r\\nto get him up on the truck.', 'Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people\\r\\nthe order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies\\r\\ntoo long they also would fall asleep.', 'At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir\\r\\nthe heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed\\r\\nfrom behind, and they got along better.', 'Soon they rolled the Lion out\\r\\nof the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet,\\r\\nfresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.', 'Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving\\r\\nher companion from death.', 'She had grown so fond of the big Lion she\\r\\nwas glad he had been rescued.', 'Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away\\r\\nthrough the grass to their homes.', 'The Queen of the Mice was the last\\r\\nto leave.', '\"If ever you need us again,\" she said, \"come out into the field and\\r\\ncall, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance.', 'Good-bye!\"', '\"Good-bye!\"', 'they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while Dorothy\\r\\nheld Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.', 'After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she\\r\\nate for her dinner.', '10.', 'The Guardian of the Gate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain\\r\\namong the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance;\\r\\nbut when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad\\r\\nto find himself still alive.', '\"I ran as fast as I could,\" he said, sitting down and yawning, \"but the\\r\\nflowers were too strong for me.', 'How did you get me out?\"', 'Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved\\r\\nhim from death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little\\r\\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as\\r\\nmice have saved my life.', 'How strange it all is!', 'But, comrades, what\\r\\nshall we do now?\"', '\"We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,\" said\\r\\nDorothy, \"and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.\"', 'So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again,\\r\\nthey all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through\\r\\nthe soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road\\r\\nof yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the\\r\\nGreat Oz dwelt.', 'The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was\\r\\nbeautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far\\r\\nbehind, and with it the many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades.', 'Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were\\r\\npainted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer\\r\\nevidently lived, that also was painted green.', 'They passed by several\\r\\nof these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the\\r\\ndoors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no\\r\\none came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Lion, of\\r\\nwhich they were very much afraid.', 'The people were all dressed in\\r\\nclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like\\r\\nthose of the Munchkins.', '\"This must be the Land of Oz,\" said Dorothy, \"and we are surely getting\\r\\nnear the Emerald City.\"', '\"Yes,\" answered the Scarecrow.', '\"Everything is green here, while in the\\r\\ncountry of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color.', 'But the people\\r\\ndo not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I\\'m afraid we shall\\r\\nbe unable to find a place to pass the night.\"', '\"I should like something to eat besides fruit,\" said the girl, \"and I\\'m\\r\\nsure Toto is nearly starved.', 'Let us stop at the next house and talk to\\r\\nthe people.\"', 'So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up\\r\\nto the door and knocked.', 'A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, \"What do you\\r\\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?\"', '\"We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,\" answered\\r\\nDorothy; \"and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you\\r\\nfor the world.\"', '\"Is he tame?\"', 'asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.', '\"Oh, yes,\" said the girl, \"and he is a great coward, too.', 'He will be\\r\\nmore afraid of you than you are of him.\"', '\"Well,\" said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep\\r\\nat the Lion, \"if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you\\r\\nsome supper and a place to sleep.\"', 'So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\\r\\nchildren and a man.', 'The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the\\r\\ncouch in a corner.', 'They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a\\r\\ncompany, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where are you all going?\"', '\"To the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy, \"to see the Great Oz.\"', '\"Oh, indeed!\"', 'exclaimed the man.', '\"Are you sure that Oz will see you?\"', '\"Why not?\"', 'she replied.', '\"Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence.', 'I\\r\\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\\r\\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\\r\\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"', '\"Does he never go out?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow.', '\"Never.', 'He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\\r\\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\"', '\"What is he like?\"', 'asked the girl.', '\"That is hard to tell,\" said the man thoughtfully.', '\"You see, Oz is a\\r\\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes.', 'So that some say he\\r\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\\r\\nhe looks like a cat.', 'To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\\r\\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him.', 'But who the real Oz\\r\\nis, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\"', '\"That is very strange,\" said Dorothy, \"but we must try, in some way, to\\r\\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\"', '\"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\"', 'asked the man.', '\"I want him to give me some brains,\" said the Scarecrow eagerly.', '\"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,\" declared the man.', '\"He has more\\r\\nbrains than he needs.\"', '\"And I want him to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"That will not trouble him,\" continued the man, \"for Oz has a large\\r\\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\"', '\"And I want him to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.', '\"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,\" said the man,\\r\\n\"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\\r\\nover.', 'He will be glad to give you some.\"', '\"And I want him to send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.', '\"Where is Kansas?\"', 'asked the man, with surprise.', '\"I don\\'t know,\" replied Dorothy sorrowfully, \"but it is my home, and\\r\\nI\\'m sure it\\'s somewhere.\"', '\"Very likely.', 'Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\\r\\nKansas for you.', 'But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\\r\\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he\\r\\nusually has his own way.', 'But what do YOU want?\"', 'he continued, speaking\\r\\nto Toto.', 'Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not\\r\\nspeak.', 'The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered\\r\\naround the table and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of\\r\\nscrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal.', 'The Lion ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it\\r\\nwas made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions.', 'The\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing at all.', 'Toto ate a little of\\r\\neverything, and was glad to get a good supper again.', 'The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside\\r\\nher, while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be\\r\\ndisturbed.', 'The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and\\r\\nkept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.', 'The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way,\\r\\nand soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.', '\"That must be the Emerald City,\" said Dorothy.', 'As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it\\r\\nseemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels.', 'Yet it\\r\\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\\r\\nCity.', 'It was high and thick and of a bright green color.', 'In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\\r\\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\\r\\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.', 'There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\\r\\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within.', 'Then the big gate swung slowly\\r\\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\\r\\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.', 'Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins.', 'He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his\\r\\nskin was of a greenish tint.', 'At his side was a large green box.', 'When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \"What do you wish\\r\\nin the Emerald City?\"', '\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.', 'The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\\r\\nover.', '\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\\r\\nshaking his head in perplexity.', '\"He is powerful and terrible, and if\\r\\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\\r\\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"', '\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\\r\\nScarecrow; \"it is important.', 'And we have been told that Oz is a good\\r\\nWizard.\"', '\"So he is,\" said the green man, \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\\r\\nand well.', 'But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\\r\\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\\r\\nface.', 'I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\\r\\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace.', 'But first you must put on the\\r\\nspectacles.\"', '\"Why?\"', 'asked Dorothy.']\n",

be at variance.--\\'There, Mrs.', \"Bennet.'\", '--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having\\r\\nreceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be\\r\\ndistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has\\r\\npreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be\\r\\nmy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her\\r\\nladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which\\r\\nare instituted by the Church of England.', 'As a clergyman, moreover, I\\r\\nfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in\\r\\nall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I\\r\\nflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and\\r\\nthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate\\r\\nwill be kindly overlooked on your side,

satisfaction of waiting\\r\\non you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o\\'clock, and\\r\\nshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se\\'ennight\\r\\nfollowing, which

marrying, and burying\\r\\nhis parishioners whenever it were required.', '\"He must be an oddity, I think,\" said she.', '\"I cannot make him\\r\\nout.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he\\r\\nmean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he\\r\\nwould help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?\"', '\"No, my dear, I think not.', 'I have great hopes of finding him quite the\\r\\nreverse.', 'There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his\\r\\nletter, which promises well.', 'I am impatient to see him.\"', '\"In point of composition,\" said Mary, \"the letter does not seem\\r\\ndefective.', 'The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I\\r\\nthink it is well expressed.\"', 'To Catherine

they had\\r\\nreceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour.', \"As for\\r\\ntheir mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,\\r\\nand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which\\r\\nastonished her husband and daughters.\", 'Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great\\r\\npoliteness by the whole family.', 'Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the\\r\\nladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in\\r\\nneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself.', 'He was a\\r\\ntall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty.', 'His air was grave and\\r\\nstately, and his manners were very formal.', 'He had not been long seated\\r\\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family

perhaps,\\r\\nwhen we are better acquainted--\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each\\r\\nother.', \"They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration.\", \"The\\r\\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\\r\\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's\\r\\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\\r\\nown future property.\", 'The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and\\r\\nhe begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its\\r\\ncooking was owing.', 'But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who\\r\\nassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a\\r\\ngood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen.', 'He\\r\\nbegged pardon for having displeased her.', 'In a softened tone she declared\\r\\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a\\r\\nquarter of an hour.', 'Chapter 14\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\\r\\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\\r\\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\\r\\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness.', \"Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for\\r\\nhis comfort, appeared very remarkable.\", 'Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\\r\\nbetter.', 'Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise.', 'The subject elevated him\\r\\nto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect\\r\\nhe protested that \"he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in\\r\\na person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\\r\\nexperienced from Lady Catherine.', 'She had been graciously pleased to\\r\\napprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of\\r\\npreaching before her.', 'She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\\r\\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\\r\\nquadrille in the evening.', 'Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\\r\\npeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.', 'She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\\r\\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\\r\\nneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or\\r\\ntwo, to visit his relations.', 'She had even condescended to advise him to\\r\\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\\r\\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\\r\\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\\r\\nto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.\"', '\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and\\r\\nI dare say she is a very agreeable woman.', 'It is a pity that great ladies\\r\\nin general are not more like her.', 'Does she live near you, sir?\"', '\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\\r\\nfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship\\'s residence.\"', '\"I think you said she was a widow, sir?', 'Has she any family?\"', '\"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\\r\\nextensive property.\"', '\"Ah!\"', 'said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\\r\\nmany girls.', 'And what sort of young lady is she?', 'Is she handsome?\"', '\"She is a most charming young lady indeed.', 'Lady Catherine herself says\\r\\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\\r\\nhandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks\\r\\nthe young lady of distinguished birth.', 'She is unfortunately of a sickly\\r\\nconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many\\r\\naccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am\\r\\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\\r\\nresides with them.', 'But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\\r\\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"', '\"Has she been presented?', 'I do not remember her name among the ladies at\\r\\ncourt.\"', '\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\\r\\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the\\r\\nBritish court of its brightest ornament.', 'Her ladyship seemed pleased\\r\\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\\r\\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable\\r\\nto ladies.', 'I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that\\r\\nher charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most\\r\\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\\r\\nher.', 'These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and\\r\\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\\r\\npay.\"', '\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet, \"and it is happy for you\\r\\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy.', 'May I ask\\r\\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\\r\\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?\"', '\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I\\r\\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\\r\\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\\r\\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\"', \"Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered.\", 'His cousin was as absurd\\r\\nas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\\r\\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\\r\\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\\r\\nin his pleasure.', 'By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad\\r\\nto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,\\r\\nglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies.', 'Mr. Collins readily\\r\\nassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything\\r\\nannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and\\r\\nbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels.', 'Kitty stared at\\r\\nhim, and Lydia exclaimed.', \"Other books were produced, and after some\\r\\ndeliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons.\", 'Lydia gaped as he opened the\\r\\nvolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three\\r\\npages, she interrupted him with:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away\\r\\nRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him.', 'My aunt told me\\r\\nso herself on Saturday.', 'I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\\r\\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"', 'Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\\r\\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\\r\\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit.', 'It amazes\\r\\nme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to\\r\\nthem as instruction.', 'But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"', 'Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\\r\\nbackgammon.', 'Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\\r\\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.', \"Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's\\r\\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\\r\\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\\r\\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\\r\\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\\r\\nfor backgammon.\", 'Chapter 15\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had\\r\\nbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part\\r\\nof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and\\r\\nmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he\\r\\nhad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful\\r\\nacquaintance.', 'The subjection in which his father had brought him up had\\r\\ngiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a\\r\\ngood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in\\r\\nretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected\\r\\nprosperity.', 'A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which\\r\\nhe felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,\\r\\nmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a\\r\\nclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of\\r\\npride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.', 'Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to\\r\\nmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had\\r\\na wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found\\r\\nthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.', \"This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's\\r\\nestate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and\\r\\nsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own\\r\\npart.\", 'His plan did not vary on seeing them.', \"Miss Bennet's lovely face\\r\\nconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what\\r\\nwas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled\\r\\nchoice.\", \"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a\\r\\nquarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a\\r\\nconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally\\r\\nto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at\\r\\nLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general\\r\\nencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.\", '\"As to\\r\\nher _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could\\r\\nnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her\\r\\n_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her\\r\\nto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.\"', 'Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon\\r\\ndone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.', 'Elizabeth, equally\\r\\nnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.', 'Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have\\r\\ntwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of\\r\\nthe day before was now high in her good graces.', \"Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister\\r\\nexcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,\\r\\nat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,\\r\\nand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed\\r\\nhim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with\\r\\none of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.\\r\\nBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford.\", 'Such\\r\\ndoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly.', 'In his library he had been\\r\\nalways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told\\r\\nElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the\\r\\nhouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,\\r\\nwas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their\\r\\nwalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker\\r\\nthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.', 'In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his\\r\\ncousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton.', 'The attention of\\r\\nthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him.', 'Their eyes were\\r\\nimmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and\\r\\nnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in\\r\\na shop window, could recall them.', 'But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom\\r\\nthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\\r\\nwith another officer on the other side of the way.', 'The officer was\\r\\nthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came\\r\\nto inquire, and he bowed as they passed.', \"All were struck with the\\r\\nstranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,\\r\\ndetermined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under\\r\\npretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately\\r\\nhad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had\\r\\nreached the same spot.\", 'Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated\\r\\npermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with\\r\\nhim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a\\r\\ncommission in their corps.', 'This was exactly as it should be; for the\\r\\nyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.', 'His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of\\r\\nbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.', 'The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness\\r\\nof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and\\r\\nunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together\\r\\nvery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy\\r\\nand Bingley were seen riding down the street.', 'On distinguishing the\\r\\nladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and\\r\\nbegan the usual civilities.', 'Bingley was the principal spokesman, and\\r\\nMiss Bennet the principal object.', 'He was then, he said, on his way to\\r\\nLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her.', 'Mr. Darcy corroborated\\r\\nit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes\\r\\non Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the\\r\\nstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they\\r\\nlooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.', 'Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red.', 'Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nafter a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just\\r\\ndeigned to return.', 'What could be the meaning of it?', 'It was impossible to\\r\\nimagine; it was impossible not to long to know.', 'In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\\r\\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.', \"Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\\r\\nMr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's\\r\\npressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of\\r\\nMrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the\\r\\ninvitation.\", \"Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,\\r\\nfrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was\\r\\neagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as\\r\\ntheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing\\r\\nabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the\\r\\nstreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to\\r\\nNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility\\r\\nwas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him.\", 'She\\r\\nreceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned with\\r\\nas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous\\r\\nacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,\\r\\nhowever, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who\\r\\nintroduced him to her notice.', \"Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an\\r\\nexcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon\\r\\nput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,\\r\\nhowever, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that\\r\\nMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a\\r\\nlieutenant's commission in the ----shire.\", 'She had been watching him the\\r\\nlast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.\\r\\nWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the\\r\\noccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the\\r\\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\\r\\ndisagreeable fellows.\"', 'Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses\\r\\nthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\\r\\nwould come in the evening.', 'This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips\\r\\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\\r\\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards.', 'The prospect of such\\r\\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits.', 'Mr.\\r\\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured\\r\\nwith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.', 'As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass\\r\\nbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either\\r\\nor both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain\\r\\nsuch behaviour than her sister.', \"Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring\\r\\nMrs. Phillips's manners and politeness.\", 'He protested that, except Lady\\r\\nCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;\\r\\nfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even\\r\\npointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although\\r\\nutterly unknown to her before.', 'Something, he supposed, might be\\r\\nattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so\\r\\nmuch attention in the whole course of his life.', \"Chapter 16\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their\\r\\naunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for\\r\\na single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach\\r\\nconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and\\r\\nthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in\\r\\nthe house.\", \"When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\r\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\r\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\r\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast\\r\\nparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\r\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what\\r\\nRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the\\r\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found\\r\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\r\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\r\\nwith the housekeeper's room.\", 'In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\r\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and\\r\\nthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\r\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive\\r\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\r\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\r\\nsoon as she could.', 'To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\r\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\r\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the\\r\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long.', 'It was over at last, however.', 'The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,\\r\\nElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking\\r\\nof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.', 'The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\r\\ngentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but\\r\\nMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\r\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,\\r\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.', 'Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\\r\\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\\r\\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\\r\\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel\\r\\nthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered\\r\\ninteresting by the skill of the speaker.', 'With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\r\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\r\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\r\\nlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\r\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.', 'When the card-tables were placed, he\\r\\nhad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.', '\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad\\r\\nto improve myself, for in my situation in life--\" Mrs. Phillips was very\\r\\nglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.', 'Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\\r\\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia.', \"At first there\\r\\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\r\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\r\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\r\\nand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.\", 'Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\r\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear\\r\\nhim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be\\r\\ntold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.', 'She dared not\\r\\neven mention that gentleman.', 'Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\\r\\nrelieved.', 'Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.', 'He inquired how far\\r\\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\\r\\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.', '\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\\r\\ndrop, added, \"He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\\r\\nunderstand.\"', '\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one.', 'A clear\\r\\nten thousand per annum.', 'You could not have met with a person more\\r\\ncapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for\\r\\nI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my\\r\\ninfancy.\"', 'Elizabeth could not but look surprised.', '\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\r\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\r\\nyesterday.', 'Are you much acquainted with Mr.', 'Darcy?\"', '\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth very warmly.', '\"I have\\r\\nspent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\r\\ndisagreeable.\"', '\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\\r\\nagreeable or otherwise.', 'I am not qualified to form one.', 'I have known him\\r\\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge.', 'It is impossible for _me_\\r\\nto be impartial.', 'But I believe your opinion of him would in general\\r\\nastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly\\r\\nanywhere else.', 'Here you are in your own family.\"', '\"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in\\r\\nthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield.', 'He is not at all liked in\\r\\nHertfordshire.', 'Everybody is disgusted with his pride.', 'You will not find\\r\\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"', '\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\\r\\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\\r\\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen.', 'The\\r\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\r\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"', '\"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\nill-tempered man.\"', 'Wickham only shook his head.', '\"I wonder,\" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, \"whether he is\\r\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.\"', '\"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\r\\nwas at Netherfield.', 'I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\r\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"', '\"Oh!', 'no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.', 'If _he_\\r\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go.', 'We are not on friendly terms,\\r\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\r\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense\\r\\nof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he\\r\\nis.', 'His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\r\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never\\r\\nbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by\\r\\na thousand tender recollections.', 'His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\r\\nmemory of his father.\"', 'Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\r\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.', 'Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\r\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that\\r\\nhe had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very\\r\\nintelligible gallantry.', '\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\\r\\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.', 'I knew it to be\\r\\na most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me\\r\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\r\\nattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.', 'Society, I own, is necessary to me.', 'I have been a disappointed man, and\\r\\nmy spirits will not bear solitude.', 'I _must_ have employment and society.', 'A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\r\\nnow made it eligible.', 'The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\r\\nwas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in\\r\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\r\\nwere speaking of just now.\"', '\"Indeed!\"', '\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\r\\nliving in his gift.', 'He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.', 'I cannot do justice to his kindness.', 'He meant to provide for me amply,\\r\\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\\r\\nelsewhere.\"', '\"Good heavens!\"', 'cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be?', 'How could his\\r\\nwill be disregarded?', 'Why did you not seek legal redress?\"', '\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\r\\ngive me no hope from law.', 'A man of honour could not have doubted the\\r\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\r\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\r\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing.', 'Certain\\r\\nit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was\\r\\nof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\r\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\r\\nanything to deserve to lose it.', 'I have a warm, unguarded temper, and\\r\\nI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely.', 'I can\\r\\nrecall nothing worse.', 'But the fact is, that we are very different sort\\r\\nof men, and that he hates me.\"', '\"This is quite shocking!', 'He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"', '\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_.', 'Till I\\r\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"', 'Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\r\\never as he expressed them.', '\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive?', 'What can\\r\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?\"', '\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\r\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy.', \"Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\r\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\\r\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.\", 'He had\\r\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\r\\nof preference which was often given me.\"', '\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\r\\nhim.', 'I had not thought so very ill of him.', 'I had supposed him to be\\r\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\r\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\r\\nthis.\"', 'After a few minutes\\' reflection, however, she continued, \"I _do_\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\r\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.', 'His disposition\\r\\nmust be dreadful.\"', '\"I will not trust myself on the subject,\" replied Wickham; \"I can hardly\\r\\nbe just to him.\"', 'Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \"To\\r\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\r\\nfather!\"', 'She could have added, \"A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\r\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable\"--but she contented herself\\r\\nwith, \"and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,\\r\\nconnected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\"', '\"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\r\\npart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,\\r\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.', '_My_\\r\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,\\r\\nappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of\\r\\nuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the\\r\\nPemberley property.', 'He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\r\\nintimate, confidential friend.', 'Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\\r\\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father\\'s active superintendence,\\r\\nand when, immediately before my father\\'s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\\r\\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to\\r\\nbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\"', '\"How strange!\"', 'cried Elizabeth.', '\"How abominable!', 'I wonder that the very\\r\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!', 'If from no better\\r\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for\\r\\ndishonesty I must call it.\"', '\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham, \"for almost all his actions may\\r\\nbe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.', 'It has\\r\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling.', 'But we are\\r\\nnone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\r\\nimpulses even than pride.\"', '\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"', '\"Yes.', 'It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money\\r\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\r\\npoor.', 'Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what\\r\\nhis father was--have done this.', 'Not to appear to disgrace his family,\\r\\nto degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\r\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive.', 'He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\r\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\r\\ncareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up\\r\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.\"', '\"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\"', 'He shook his head.', '\"I wish I could call her amiable.', 'It gives me pain to\\r\\nspeak ill of a Darcy.', 'But she is too much like her brother--very, very\\r\\nproud.', 'As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\\r\\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement.', 'But she is\\r\\nnothing to me now.', 'She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\\r\\nand, I understand, highly accomplished.', 'Since her father\\'s death, her\\r\\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\\r\\neducation.\"', 'After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not\\r\\nhelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!', 'How can Mr. Bingley,\\r\\nwho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\r\\nbe in friendship with such a man?', 'How can they suit each other?', 'Do you\\r\\nknow Mr.', 'Bingley?\"', '\"Not at all.\"', '\"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man.', 'He cannot know what Mr.\\r\\nDarcy is.\"', '\"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.', 'He does not\\r\\nwant abilities.', 'He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\\r\\nhis while.', 'Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is\\r\\na very different man from what he is to the less prosperous.', 'His\\r\\npride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\\r\\nsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something\\r\\nfor fortune and figure.\"', 'The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\\r\\nthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\\r\\nElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips.', 'The usual inquiries as to his success were\\r\\nmade by the latter.', 'It had not been very great; he had lost every\\r\\npoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,\\r\\nhe assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least\\r\\nimportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged\\r\\nthat she would not make herself uneasy.', '\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\\r\\ncard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I\\r\\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.', 'There\\r\\nare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady\\r\\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\\r\\nlittle matters.\"', \"Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\\r\\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation\\r\\nwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.\", '\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him\\r\\na living.', 'I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\\r\\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"', '\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\\r\\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr.', 'Darcy.\"', '\"No, indeed, I did not.', \"I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\\r\\nconnections.\", 'I never heard of her existence till the day before\\r\\nyesterday.\"', '\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\\r\\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"', 'This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\\r\\nBingley.', 'Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\\r\\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\\r\\nself-destined for another.', '\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\\r\\ndaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,\\r\\nI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his\\r\\npatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"', '\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\\r\\nnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked\\r\\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent.', 'She has the\\r\\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\\r\\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\\r\\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her\\r\\nnephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an\\r\\nunderstanding of the first class.\"', \"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\\r\\nthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper\\r\\nput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.\\r\\nWickham's attentions.\", \"There could be no conversation in the noise\\r\\nof Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to\\r\\neverybody.\", 'Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done\\r\\ngracefully.', 'Elizabeth went away with her head full of him.', 'She could\\r\\nthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all\\r\\nthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name\\r\\nas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.', 'Lydia\\r\\ntalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the\\r\\nfish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and\\r\\nMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses\\r\\nat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing\\r\\nthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage\\r\\nbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.', 'Chapter 17\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.\\r\\nWickham and herself.', \"Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she\\r\\nknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.\\r\\nBingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the\\r\\nveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.\", 'The\\r\\npossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to\\r\\ninterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be\\r\\ndone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,\\r\\nand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be\\r\\notherwise explained.', '\"They have both,\" said she, \"been deceived, I dare say, in some way\\r\\nor other, of which we can form no idea.', 'Interested people have perhaps\\r\\nmisrepresented each to the other.', 'It is, in short, impossible for us to\\r\\nconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,\\r\\nwithout actual blame on either side.\"', '\"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on\\r\\nbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the\\r\\nbusiness?', 'Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of\\r\\nsomebody.\"', '\"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my\\r\\nopinion.', \"My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light\\r\\nit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such\\r\\na manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for.\", 'It is\\r\\nimpossible.', 'No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his\\r\\ncharacter, could be capable of it.', 'Can his most intimate friends be so\\r\\nexcessively deceived in him?', 'Oh!', 'no.\"', '\"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\\'s being imposed on, than\\r\\nthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me\\r\\nlast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony.', 'If it\\r\\nbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it.', 'Besides, there was truth in his\\r\\nlooks.\"', '\"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.', 'One does not know what to\\r\\nthink.\"', '\"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\"', 'But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,\\r\\nif he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair\\r\\nbecame public.', 'The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this\\r\\nconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had\\r\\nbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal\\r\\ninvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed\\r\\nfor the following Tuesday.', 'The two ladies were delighted to see their\\r\\ndear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly\\r\\nasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation.', 'To\\r\\nthe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to\\r\\nthe others.', \"They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an\\r\\nactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if\\r\\neager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.\", 'The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every\\r\\nfemale of the family.', 'Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in\\r\\ncompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered\\r\\nby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a\\r\\nceremonious card.', \"Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the\\r\\nsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and\\r\\nElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.\\r\\nWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look\\r\\nand behaviour.\", 'The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended\\r\\nless on any single event, or any particular person, for though they\\r\\neach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,\\r\\nhe was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball\\r\\nwas, at any rate, a ball.', 'And even Mary could assure her family that she\\r\\nhad no disinclination for it.', '\"While I can have my mornings to myself,\" said she, \"it is enough--I\\r\\nthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.', 'Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those\\r\\nwho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for\\r\\neverybody.\"', \"Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did\\r\\nnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking\\r\\nhim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if\\r\\nhe did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's\\r\\namusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no\\r\\nscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke\\r\\neither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to\\r\\ndance.\", '\"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\" said he, \"that a ball\\r\\nof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,\\r\\ncan have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing\\r\\nmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair\\r\\ncousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of\\r\\nsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,\\r\\na preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right\\r\\ncause, and not to any disrespect for her.\"', 'Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.', 'She had fully proposed being\\r\\nengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\\r\\ninstead!', 'her liveliness had never been worse timed.', 'There was no help\\r\\nfor it, however.', \"Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce\\r\\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\\r\\ngood a grace as she could.\", 'She was not the better pleased with his\\r\\ngallantry from the idea it suggested of something more.', 'It now first\\r\\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy\\r\\nof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\\r\\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.', 'The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\\r\\ncivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\\r\\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\\r\\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\\r\\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\\r\\nwas extremely agreeable to _her_.', 'Elizabeth, however, did not choose\\r\\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\\r\\nconsequence of any reply.', 'Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and\\r\\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.', 'If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the\\r\\nyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this\\r\\ntime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there\\r\\nwas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton\\r\\nonce.', 'No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very\\r\\nshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy.', 'Even Elizabeth might have\\r\\nfound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the\\r\\nimprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than\\r\\na dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and\\r\\nMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.', 'Chapter 18\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in\\r\\nvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a\\r\\ndoubt of his being present had never occurred to her.', 'The certainty\\r\\nof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that\\r\\nmight not unreasonably have alarmed her.', 'She had dressed with more than\\r\\nusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all\\r\\nthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than\\r\\nmight be won in the course of the evening.', 'But in an instant arose\\r\\nthe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\\'s\\r\\npleasure in the Bingleys\\' invitation to the officers; and though\\r\\nthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was\\r\\npronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who\\r\\ntold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the\\r\\nday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,\\r\\n\"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if\\r\\nhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\"', \"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by\\r\\nElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for\\r\\nWickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every\\r\\nfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate\\r\\ndisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to\\r\\nthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.\", 'Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham.', 'She\\r\\nwas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away\\r\\nwith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in\\r\\nspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.', 'But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect\\r\\nof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her\\r\\nspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had\\r\\nnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition\\r\\nto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular\\r\\nnotice.', 'The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;\\r\\nthey were dances of mortification.', 'Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,\\r\\napologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being\\r\\naware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable\\r\\npartner for a couple of dances can give.', 'The moment of her release from\\r\\nhim was ecstasy.', 'She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of\\r\\nWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked.', 'When those dances\\r\\nwere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with\\r\\nher, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took\\r\\nher so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,\\r\\nwithout knowing what she did, she accepted him.', 'He walked away again\\r\\nimmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of\\r\\nmind; Charlotte tried to console her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dare say you will find him very agreeable.\"', '\"Heaven forbid!', '_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!', 'To find\\r\\na man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!', 'Do not wish me such an\\r\\nevil.\"', 'When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\\r\\nhand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a\\r\\nsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\\r\\nin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.', \"Elizabeth made no\\r\\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\\r\\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\\r\\nreading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding\\r\\nit.\", 'They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\\r\\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at\\r\\nfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would\\r\\nbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made\\r\\nsome slight observation on the dance.', 'He replied, and was again\\r\\nsilent.', 'After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time\\r\\nwith:--\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy.', 'I talked\\r\\nabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size\\r\\nof the room, or the number of couples.\"', 'He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\\r\\nsaid.', '\"Very well.', 'That reply will do for the present.', 'Perhaps by and by I may\\r\\nobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.', 'But\\r\\n_now_ we may be silent.\"', '\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"', '\"Sometimes.', 'One must speak a little, you know.', 'It would look odd to be\\r\\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of\\r\\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the\\r\\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"', '\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\\r\\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"', '\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\\r\\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds.', 'We are each of an unsocial,\\r\\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\\r\\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\\r\\nposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.\"', '\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\\r\\nsaid he.', '\"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.', '_You_\\r\\nthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.\"', '\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"', 'He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down\\r\\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\\r\\nwalk to Meryton.', 'She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist\\r\\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\\r\\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"', 'The effect was immediate.', 'A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\\r\\nfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\\r\\nfor her own weakness, could not go on.', 'At length Darcy spoke, and in a\\r\\nconstrained manner said, \"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners\\r\\nas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of\\r\\n_retaining_ them, is less certain.\"', '\"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,\" replied Elizabeth\\r\\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\\r\\nhis life.\"', 'Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject.', 'At\\r\\nthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\\r\\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on\\r\\nhis dancing and his partner.', '\"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir.', 'Such very\\r\\nsuperior dancing is not often seen.', 'It is evident that you belong to the\\r\\nfirst circles.', 'Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\\r\\ndisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\\r\\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at\\r\\nher sister and Bingley) shall take place.', 'What congratulations will then\\r\\nflow in!', 'I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir.', 'You\\r\\nwill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that\\r\\nyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"', \"The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\\r\\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\\r\\neyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and\\r\\nJane, who were dancing together.\", 'Recovering himself, however, shortly,\\r\\nhe turned to his partner, and said, \"Sir William\\'s interruption has made\\r\\nme forget what we were talking of.\"', '\"I do not think we were speaking at all.', 'Sir William could not have\\r\\ninterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.', 'We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we\\r\\nare to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"', '\"What think you of books?\"', 'said he, smiling.', '\"Books--oh!', 'no.', 'I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\\r\\nfeelings.\"', '\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\\r\\nno want of subject.', 'We may compare our different opinions.\"', '\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\\r\\nsomething else.\"', '\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\"', 'said he,\\r\\nwith a look of doubt.', '\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her\\r\\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\\r\\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\\r\\nthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was\\r\\nunappeasable.', 'You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\\r\\ncreated_.\"', '\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.', '\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"', '\"I hope not.\"', '\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\\r\\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"', '\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"', '\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\\r\\nto shake off her gravity.', '\"I am trying to make it out.\"', '\"And what is your success?\"', 'She shook her head.', '\"I do not get on at all.', 'I hear such different\\r\\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"', '\"I can readily believe,\" answered he gravely, \"that reports may vary\\r\\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\\r\\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\\r\\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"', '\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\\r\\nopportunity.\"', '\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.', \"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\\r\\nsilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,\\r\\nfor in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards\\r\\nher, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\\r\\nanother.\", 'They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and\\r\\nwith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!', \"Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\\r\\nquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among\\r\\nhis other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late\\r\\nMr. Darcy's steward.\", \"Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to\\r\\ngive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's\\r\\nusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has\\r\\nalways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated\\r\\nMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner.\", 'I do not know the particulars, but\\r\\nI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he\\r\\ncannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother\\r\\nthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to\\r\\nthe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself\\r\\nout of the way.', 'His coming into the country at all is a most insolent\\r\\nthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it.', 'I pity you,\\r\\nMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\\'s guilt; but really,\\r\\nconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.\"', '\"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\" said\\r\\nElizabeth angrily; \"for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse\\r\\nthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy\\'s steward, and of _that_, I can\\r\\nassure you, he informed me himself.\"', '\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.', '\"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.\"', '\"Insolent girl!\"', 'said Elizabeth to herself.', '\"You are much mistaken\\r\\nif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this.', 'I see\\r\\nnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.', 'Darcy.\"', 'She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\\r\\ninquiries on the same subject of Bingley.', 'Jane met her with a smile of\\r\\nsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\\r\\nmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.', \"Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for\\r\\nWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way\\r\\nbefore the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.\", '\"I want to know,\" said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\\r\\nsister\\'s, \"what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.', 'But perhaps you have\\r\\nbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case\\r\\nyou may be sure of my pardon.\"', '\"No,\" replied Jane, \"I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\\r\\nsatisfactory to tell you.', \"Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of\\r\\nhis history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\\r\\nprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\\r\\nthe probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\\r\\nMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\\r\\nreceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,\\r\\nMr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man.\", 'I am afraid he has\\r\\nbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\\'s regard.\"', '\"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\"', '\"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\"', '\"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy.', 'I am\\r\\nsatisfied.', 'But what does he say of the living?\"', '\"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\\r\\nthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\\r\\nhim _conditionally_ only.\"', '\"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\\'s sincerity,\" said Elizabeth warmly;\\r\\n\"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.', 'Mr.\\r\\nBingley\\'s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\\r\\nsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\\r\\nthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of\\r\\nboth gentlemen as I did before.\"', 'She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\\r\\nwhich there could be no difference of sentiment.', \"Elizabeth listened with\\r\\ndelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.\\r\\nBingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\\r\\nin it.\", 'On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\\r\\nto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\\r\\npartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\\r\\nand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as\\r\\nto make a most important discovery.', '\"I have found out,\" said he, \"by a singular accident, that there is now\\r\\nin the room a near relation of my patroness.', 'I happened to overhear the\\r\\ngentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\\r\\nthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady\\r\\nCatherine.', 'How wonderfully these sort of things occur!', 'Who would have\\r\\nthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de\\r\\nBourgh in this assembly!', 'I am most thankful that the discovery is made\\r\\nin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to\\r\\ndo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.', 'My total\\r\\nignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\"', '\"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr.', 'Darcy!\"', '\"Indeed I am.', 'I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.', \"I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_.\", 'It will be in my power to\\r\\nassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\\'nnight.\"', 'Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him\\r\\nthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction\\r\\nas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that\\r\\nit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\\r\\nside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\\r\\nconsequence, to begin the acquaintance.', 'Mr. Collins listened to her\\r\\nwith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she\\r\\nceased speaking, replied thus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in\\r\\nyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your\\r\\nunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide\\r\\ndifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,\\r\\nand those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that\\r\\nI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with\\r\\nthe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of\\r\\nbehaviour is at the same time maintained.', 'You must therefore allow me to\\r\\nfollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to\\r\\nperform what I look on as a point of duty.', 'Pardon me for neglecting to\\r\\nprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant\\r\\nguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by\\r\\neducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young\\r\\nlady like yourself.\"', 'And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.\\r\\nDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose\\r\\nastonishment at being so addressed was very evident.', 'Her cousin prefaced\\r\\nhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of\\r\\nit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the\\r\\nwords \"apology,\" \"Hunsford,\" and \"Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\"', 'It vexed\\r\\nher to see him expose himself to such a man.', 'Mr. Darcy was eyeing him\\r\\nwith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time\\r\\nto speak, replied with an air of distant civility.', \"Mr. Collins, however,\\r\\nwas not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed\\r\\nabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the\\r\\nend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way.\", 'Mr.\\r\\nCollins then returned to Elizabeth.', '\"I have no reason, I assure you,\" said he, \"to be dissatisfied with my\\r\\nreception.', 'Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention.', \"He answered\\r\\nme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying\\r\\nthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be\\r\\ncertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily.\", 'It was really a very\\r\\nhandsome thought.', 'Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\"', 'As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\\r\\nher attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\\r\\ntrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,\\r\\nmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane.', \"She saw her in idea settled in\\r\\nthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection\\r\\ncould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of\\r\\nendeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters.\", \"Her mother's thoughts\\r\\nshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to\\r\\nventure near her, lest she might hear too much.\", 'When they sat down to\\r\\nsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which\\r\\nplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find\\r\\nthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,\\r\\nopenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon\\r\\nbe married to Mr. Bingley.', 'It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet\\r\\nseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the\\r\\nmatch.', 'His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but\\r\\nthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and\\r\\nthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of\\r\\nJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as\\r\\nshe could do.', \"It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger\\r\\ndaughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of\\r\\nother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be\\r\\nable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that\\r\\nshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked.\", 'It was\\r\\nnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on\\r\\nsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\\r\\nBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.', 'She\\r\\nconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\\r\\nfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\\r\\nchance of it.', \"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's\\r\\nwords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible\\r\\nwhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the\\r\\nchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them.\", 'Her\\r\\nmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.', '\"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him?', 'I am\\r\\nsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say\\r\\nnothing _he_ may not like to hear.\"', '\"For heaven\\'s sake, madam, speak lower.', 'What advantage can it be for you\\r\\nto offend Mr. Darcy?', 'You will never recommend yourself to his friend by\\r\\nso doing!\"', 'Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.', 'Her mother would\\r\\ntalk of her views in the same intelligible tone.', 'Elizabeth blushed and\\r\\nblushed again with shame and vexation.', 'She could not help frequently\\r\\nglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\\r\\nshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\\r\\nconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her.', 'The expression\\r\\nof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\\r\\nsteady gravity.', 'At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who\\r\\nhad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\\r\\nlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and\\r\\nchicken.', 'Elizabeth now began to revive.', 'But not long was the interval of\\r\\ntranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and\\r\\nshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\\r\\npreparing to oblige the company.', 'By many significant looks and silent\\r\\nentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,\\r\\nbut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of\\r\\nexhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.', \"Elizabeth's\\r\\neyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her\\r\\nprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very\\r\\nill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks\\r\\nof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to\\r\\nfavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.\", \"Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was\\r\\nweak, and her manner affected.\", 'Elizabeth was in agonies.', 'She looked at\\r\\nJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to\\r\\nBingley.', 'She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs\\r\\nof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\\r\\nimperturbably grave.', 'She looked at her father to entreat his\\r\\ninterference, lest Mary should be singing all night.', 'He took the hint,\\r\\nand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \"That will do\\r\\nextremely well, child.', 'You have delighted us long enough.', 'Let the other\\r\\nyoung ladies have time to exhibit.\"', \"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\\r\\nElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid\\r\\nher anxiety had done no good.\", 'Others of the party were now applied to.', '\"If I,\" said Mr. Collins, \"were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\\r\\nshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\\r\\nair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\\r\\ncompatible with the profession of a clergyman.', 'I do not mean, however,\\r\\nto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time\\r\\nto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to.', 'The\\r\\nrector of a parish has much to do.', 'In the first place, he must make\\r\\nsuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\\r\\noffensive to his patron.', 'He must write his own sermons; and the time\\r\\nthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\\r\\nand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\\r\\nas comfortable as possible.', 'And I do not think it of light importance\\r\\nthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,\\r\\nespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment.', 'I cannot acquit\\r\\nhim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an\\r\\noccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the\\r\\nfamily.\"', 'And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had\\r\\nbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.', 'Many stared--many\\r\\nsmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his\\r\\nwife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,\\r\\nand observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably\\r\\nclever, good kind of young man.', 'To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to\\r\\nexpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\\r\\nhave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or\\r\\nfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\\r\\nthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\\r\\nfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\\r\\nmust have witnessed.', 'That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\\r\\nhave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,\\r\\nand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the\\r\\ngentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.', 'The rest of the evening brought her little amusement.', 'She was teased by\\r\\nMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though\\r\\nhe could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her\\r\\npower to dance with others.', 'In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\\r\\nsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.', 'He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;\\r\\nthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to\\r\\nher and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her\\r\\nthe whole evening.', 'There was no arguing upon such a project.', \"She owed\\r\\nher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and\\r\\ngood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.\", \"She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;\\r\\nthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\\r\\ndisengaged, he never came near enough to speak.\", 'She felt it to be the\\r\\nprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\\r\\nit.', 'The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by\\r\\na manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of\\r\\nan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\\r\\nheartily they were wished away by some of the family.', 'Mrs. Hurst and her\\r\\nsister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and\\r\\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves.', 'They repulsed\\r\\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a\\r\\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the\\r\\nlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\\r\\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\\r\\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests.', 'Darcy said\\r\\nnothing at all.', 'Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.', 'Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the\\r\\nrest, and talked only to each other.', 'Elizabeth preserved as steady a\\r\\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\\r\\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\\r\\nhow tired I am!\"', 'accompanied by a violent yawn.', 'When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\\r\\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and\\r\\naddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he\\r\\nwould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without\\r\\nthe ceremony of a formal invitation.', 'Bingley was all grateful pleasure,\\r\\nand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on\\r\\nher, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next\\r\\nday for a short time.', 'Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the\\r\\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\\r\\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\\r\\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\\r\\nmonths.', 'Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought\\r\\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.', 'Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\\r\\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\\r\\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.', 'Chapter 19\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn.', 'Mr. Collins made his\\r\\ndeclaration in form.', 'Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\\r\\nhis leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\\r\\nno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at\\r\\nthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\\r\\nobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business.', 'On\\r\\nfinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,\\r\\nsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\\r\\nwhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\\r\\ncourse of this morning?\"', 'Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\\r\\nBennet answered instantly, \"Oh dear!--yes--certainly.', 'I am sure Lizzy\\r\\nwill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.', 'Come, Kitty, I\\r\\nwant you up stairs.\"', 'And, gathering her work together, she was hastening\\r\\naway, when Elizabeth called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dear madam, do not go.', 'I beg you will not go.', 'Mr. Collins must excuse\\r\\nme.', 'He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear.', 'I am\\r\\ngoing away myself.\"', '\"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.', 'I desire you to stay where you are.\"', 'And upon\\r\\nElizabeth\\'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to\\r\\nescape, she added: \"Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.', 'Collins.\"', \"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's\\r\\nconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it\\r\\nover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to\\r\\nconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between\\r\\ndistress and diversion.\", 'Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as\\r\\nthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.', '\"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\\r\\ndoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.', \"You\\r\\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\\r\\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected\\r\\nmother's permission for this address.\", 'You can hardly doubt the\\r\\npurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\\r\\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken.', 'Almost as\\r\\nsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of\\r\\nmy future life.', 'But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\\r\\nsubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for\\r\\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\\r\\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"', 'The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\\r\\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could\\r\\nnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,\\r\\nand he continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\\r\\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\\r\\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will\\r\\nadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought\\r\\nto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\\r\\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\\r\\npatroness.', 'Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\\r\\ntoo!)', \"on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\\r\\nleft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\\r\\narranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr.\", 'Collins, you\\r\\nmust marry.', 'A clergyman like you must marry.', 'Choose properly, choose\\r\\na gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,\\r\\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\\r\\nincome go a good way.', 'This is my advice.', \"Find such a woman as soon as\\r\\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.'\", 'Allow me, by the\\r\\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice\\r\\nand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\\r\\nadvantages in my power to offer.', 'You will find her manners beyond\\r\\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\\r\\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and\\r\\nrespect which her rank will inevitably excite.', 'Thus much for my general\\r\\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\\r\\nwere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\\r\\ncan assure you there are many amiable young women.', 'But the fact is, that\\r\\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\\r\\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\\r\\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\\r\\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy\\r\\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not\\r\\nbe for several years.', 'This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and\\r\\nI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem.', 'And now nothing\\r\\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\\r\\nviolence of my affection.', \"To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\\r\\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\\r\\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\\r\\nin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's\\r\\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.\", 'On that head,\\r\\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that\\r\\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"', 'It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.', '\"You are too hasty, sir,\" she cried.', '\"You forget that I have made no\\r\\nanswer.', 'Let me do it without further loss of time.', 'Accept my thanks for\\r\\nthe compliment you are paying me.', 'I am very sensible of the honour of\\r\\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to\\r\\ndecline them.\"', '\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\\r\\nhand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\\r\\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\\r\\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a\\r\\nthird time.', 'I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just\\r\\nsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"', '\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is a rather\\r\\nextraordinary one after my declaration.', 'I do assure you that I am not\\r\\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\\r\\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\\r\\ntime.', 'I am perfectly serious in my refusal.', 'You could not make _me_\\r\\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\\r\\ncould make you so.', 'Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\\r\\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\\r\\nsituation.\"', '\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins\\r\\nvery gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all\\r\\ndisapprove of you.', 'And you may be certain when I have the honour of\\r\\nseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your\\r\\nmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.\"', '\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary.', 'You\\r\\nmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment\\r\\nof believing what I say.', 'I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\\r\\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.', 'In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\\r\\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\\r\\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach.', 'This matter may\\r\\nbe considered, therefore, as finally settled.\"', 'And rising as she\\r\\nthus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus\\r\\naddressed her:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\\r\\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\\r\\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\\r\\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on\\r\\nthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to\\r\\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\\r\\nfemale character.\"', '\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\\r\\nexceedingly.', 'If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\\r\\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\\r\\nto convince you of its being one.\"', '\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\\r\\nrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course.', 'My reasons for\\r\\nbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is\\r\\nunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\\r\\nbe any other than highly desirable.', 'My situation in life, my connections\\r\\nwith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\\r\\ncircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\\r\\nconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\\r\\nmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.', 'Your\\r\\nportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo\\r\\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications.', 'As I must\\r\\ntherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,\\r\\nI shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\\r\\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"', '\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\\r\\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man.', 'I would\\r\\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere.', 'I thank you\\r\\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\\r\\nto accept them is absolutely impossible.', 'My feelings in every respect\\r\\nforbid it.', 'Can I speak plainer?', 'Do not consider me now as an elegant\\r\\nfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking\\r\\nthe truth from her heart.\"', '\"You are uniformly charming!\"', 'cried he, with an air of awkward\\r\\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express\\r\\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\\r\\nbeing acceptable.\"', 'To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make\\r\\nno reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if\\r\\nhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\\r\\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\\r\\nin such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\\r\\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.', 'Chapter 20\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\\r\\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\\r\\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open\\r\\nthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\\r\\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\\r\\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection.', 'Mr. Collins\\r\\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\\r\\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\\r\\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\\r\\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\\r\\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.', 'This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been\\r\\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\\r\\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\\r\\nand could not help saying so.', '\"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\\r\\nbrought to reason.', 'I will speak to her about it directly.', 'She is a very\\r\\nheadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will\\r\\n_make_ her know it.\"', '\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if\\r\\nshe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\\r\\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\\r\\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state.', 'If therefore she\\r\\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not\\r\\nto force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\\r\\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"', '\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.', '\"Lizzy is\\r\\nonly headstrong in such matters as these.', 'In everything else she is as\\r\\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived.', 'I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\\r\\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"', 'She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\\r\\nhusband, called out as she entered the library, \"Oh!', 'Mr. Bennet, you\\r\\nare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.', 'You must come and make\\r\\nLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you\\r\\ndo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\"', 'Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\\r\\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\\r\\nher communication.', '\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\\r\\nfinished her speech.', '\"Of what are you talking?\"', '\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy.', 'Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\\r\\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"', '\"And what am I to do on the occasion?', 'It seems an hopeless business.\"', '\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself.', 'Tell her that you insist upon her\\r\\nmarrying him.\"', '\"Let her be called down.', 'She shall hear my opinion.\"', 'Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\\r\\nlibrary.', '\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared.', '\"I have sent for\\r\\nyou on an affair of importance.', 'I understand that Mr. Collins has made\\r\\nyou an offer of marriage.', 'Is it true?\"', 'Elizabeth replied that it was.', '\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"', '\"I have, sir.\"', '\"Very well.', 'We now come to the point.', 'Your mother insists upon your\\r\\naccepting it.', 'Is it not so, Mrs.', 'Bennet?\"', '\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"', '\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth.', 'From this day you must\\r\\nbe a stranger to one of your parents.', 'Your mother will never see you\\r\\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\\r\\nif you _do_.\"', 'Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,\\r\\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\\r\\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.', '\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?', 'You promised me to\\r\\n_insist_ upon her marrying him.\"', '\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.', 'First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\\r\\npresent occasion; and secondly, of my room.', 'I shall be glad to have the\\r\\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.\"', 'Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\\r\\nMrs. Bennet give up the point.', 'She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\\r\\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns.', 'She endeavoured to secure Jane\\r\\nin her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\\r\\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\\r\\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks.', 'Though her manner\\r\\nvaried, however, her determination never did.', 'Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.', 'He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin\\r\\ncould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\\r\\nway.', \"His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\\r\\ndeserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\", 'While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\\r\\nthe day with them.', 'She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\\r\\nher, cried in a half whisper, \"I am glad you are come, for there is such\\r\\nfun here!', 'What do you think has happened this morning?', 'Mr. Collins has\\r\\nmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\"', 'Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,\\r\\nwho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\\r\\nbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\\r\\nthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\\r\\nher to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her\\r\\nfamily.', '\"Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\" she added in a melancholy tone,\\r\\n\"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me.', 'I am cruelly used,\\r\\nnobody feels for my poor nerves.\"', \"Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\", '\"Aye, there she comes,\" continued Mrs. Bennet, \"looking as unconcerned\\r\\nas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided\\r\\nshe can have her own way.', 'But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it\\r\\ninto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\\r\\nyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\\r\\nto maintain you when your father is dead.', 'I shall not be able to keep\\r\\nyou--and so I warn you.', 'I have done with you from this very day.', 'I told\\r\\nyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\\r\\nand you will find me as good as my word.', 'I have no pleasure in talking\\r\\nto undutiful children.', 'Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\\r\\nto anybody.', 'People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\\r\\nno great inclination for talking.', 'Nobody can tell what I suffer!', 'But it\\r\\nis always so.', 'Those who do not complain are never pitied.\"', 'Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that\\r\\nany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the\\r\\nirritation.', 'She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of\\r\\nthem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with\\r\\nan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to\\r\\nthe girls, \"Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold\\r\\nyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation\\r\\ntogether.\"', 'Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\\r\\nLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\\r\\ndetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\\r\\nherself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\\r\\ncuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\\r\\nnot to hear.', 'In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected\\r\\nconversation: \"Oh!', 'Mr.', 'Collins!\"', '\"My dear madam,\" replied he, \"let us be for ever silent on this point.', 'Far be it from me,\" he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\\r\\ndispleasure, \"to resent the behaviour of your daughter.', 'Resignation\\r\\nto inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a\\r\\nyoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;\\r\\nand I trust I am resigned.', 'Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt\\r\\nof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;\\r\\nfor I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as\\r\\nwhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our\\r\\nestimation.', \"You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect\\r\\nto your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to\\r\\nyour daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\\r\\ncompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my\\r\\nbehalf.\", \"My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\\r\\ndismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own.\", 'But we are all\\r\\nliable to error.', 'I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.', 'My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\\r\\nconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_\\r\\nhas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.\"', \"Chapter 21\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and\\r\\nElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\\r\\nattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her\\r\\nmother.\", 'As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly\\r\\nexpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,\\r\\nbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence.', 'He scarcely ever spoke\\r\\nto her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\\r\\nhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\\r\\ncivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\\r\\nespecially to her friend.', \"The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill\\r\\nhealth.\", 'Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride.', 'Elizabeth\\r\\nhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\\r\\nnot appear in the least affected by it.', 'He was always to have gone on\\r\\nSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.', 'After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham\\r\\nwere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.', \"He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\\r\\naunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was\\r\\nwell talked over.\", 'To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\\r\\nthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.', '\"I found,\" said he, \"as the time drew near that I had better not meet\\r\\nMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\\r\\nmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\\r\\nmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.\"', 'She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full\\r\\ndiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly\\r\\nbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\\r\\nthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to\\r\\nher.', 'His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the\\r\\ncompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an\\r\\noccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.', 'Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\\r\\nfrom Netherfield.', \"The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,\\r\\nhot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and\\r\\nElizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw\\r\\nher dwelling intently on some particular passages.\", 'Jane recollected\\r\\nherself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual\\r\\ncheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety\\r\\non the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no\\r\\nsooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane\\r\\ninvited her to follow her up stairs.', 'When they had gained their own room,\\r\\nJane, taking out the letter, said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good\\r\\ndeal.', 'The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on\\r\\ntheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again.', 'You\\r\\nshall hear what she says.\"', 'She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\\r\\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\\r\\nand of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a\\r\\nhouse.', 'The next was in these words: \"I do not pretend to regret anything\\r\\nI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;\\r\\nbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that\\r\\ndelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may\\r\\nlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved\\r\\ncorrespondence.', 'I depend on you for that.\"', \"To these highflown\\r\\nexpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;\\r\\nand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw\\r\\nnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\\r\\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\\r\\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to\\r\\nregard it, in the enjoyment of his.\", '\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\\r\\nable to see your friends before they leave the country.', 'But may we not\\r\\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\\r\\nforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\\r\\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\\r\\nsatisfaction as sisters?', 'Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\\r\\nthem.\"', '\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\\r\\nHertfordshire this winter.', 'I will read it to you:\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\\r\\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\\r\\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\\r\\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\\r\\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\\r\\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.', 'Many of my acquaintances are\\r\\nalready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my\\r\\ndearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of\\r\\nthat I despair.', 'I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may\\r\\nabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your\\r\\nbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the\\r\\nthree of whom we shall deprive you.\"', '\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\\r\\nwinter.\"', '\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\"', '\"Why will you think so?', 'It must be his own doing.', 'He is his own\\r\\nmaster.', 'But you do not know _all_.', 'I _will_ read you the passage which\\r\\nparticularly hurts me.', 'I will have no reserves from _you_.\"', '\"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,\\r\\n_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.', 'I really do not think\\r\\nGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;\\r\\nand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into\\r\\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of\\r\\nher being hereafter our sister.', 'I do not know whether I ever before\\r\\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the\\r\\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\\r\\nunreasonable.', \"My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\\r\\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;\\r\\nher relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's\\r\\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\\r\\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart.\", 'With all these circumstances to\\r\\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\\r\\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\\r\\nof so many?\"', '\"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"', 'said Jane as she\\r\\nfinished it.', '\"Is it not clear enough?', \"Does it not expressly declare that\\r\\nCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is\\r\\nperfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she\\r\\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!)\", 'to\\r\\nput me on my guard?', 'Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"', '\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.', 'Will you hear it?\"', '\"Most willingly.\"', '\"You shall have it in a few words.', 'Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\\r\\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.', 'She follows him\\r\\nto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\\r\\ndoes not care about you.\"', 'Jane shook her head.', '\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.', 'No one who has ever seen you\\r\\ntogether can doubt his affection.', 'Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot.', 'She\\r\\nis not such a simpleton.', 'Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\\r\\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.', 'But the\\r\\ncase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\\r\\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\\r\\nthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble\\r\\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and\\r\\nI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.', 'But,\\r\\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\\r\\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\\r\\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\\r\\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\\r\\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"', '\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\\r\\nrepresentation of all this might make me quite easy.', 'But I know the\\r\\nfoundation is unjust.', 'Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\\r\\nanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving\\r\\nherself.\"', '\"That is right.', 'You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\\r\\nwill not take comfort in mine.', 'Believe her to be deceived, by all means.', 'You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"', '\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\\r\\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\\r\\nelsewhere?\"', '\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth; \"and if, upon mature\\r\\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\\r\\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\\r\\nall means to refuse him.\"', '\"How can you talk so?\"', 'said Jane, faintly smiling.', '\"You must know that\\r\\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\\r\\nnot hesitate.\"', '\"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\\r\\nyour situation with much compassion.\"', '\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\\r\\nrequired.', 'A thousand things may arise in six months!\"', 'The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\\r\\ncontempt.', \"It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\\r\\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\\r\\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\\r\\nso totally independent of everyone.\", 'She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt\\r\\non the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.', \"Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\\r\\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\\r\\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\", \"They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\\r\\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\\r\\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\\r\\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\\r\\nto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together.\", 'After\\r\\nlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.\\r\\nBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the\\r\\nconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had\\r\\nbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two\\r\\nfull courses.', 'Chapter 22\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the\\r\\nchief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.', 'Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.', '\"It keeps him in good\\r\\nhumour,\" said she, \"and I am more obliged to you than I can express.\"', 'Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\\r\\nthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time.', \"This was\\r\\nvery amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\\r\\nhad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her\\r\\nfrom any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards\\r\\nherself.\", \"Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so\\r\\nfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\\r\\nsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very\\r\\nsoon.\", 'But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\\r\\ncharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\\r\\nmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\\r\\nhimself at her feet.', 'He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\\r\\nfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\\r\\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\\r\\ntill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost\\r\\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\\r\\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.', 'His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind.', 'Miss Lucas\\r\\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\\r\\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.', 'But little had\\r\\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.', \"In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,\\r\\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\\r\\nthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\\r\\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\\r\\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\\r\\nhis happiness.\", 'The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\\r\\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\\r\\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure\\r\\nand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\\r\\nestablishment were gained.', 'Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\\r\\nand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity.', \"Mr. Collins's present\\r\\ncircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\\r\\nthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\\r\\nexceedingly fair.\", \"Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\\r\\ninterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer\\r\\nMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided\\r\\nopinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the\\r\\nLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife\\r\\nshould make their appearance at St. James's.\", 'The whole family, in short,\\r\\nwere properly overjoyed on the occasion.', \"The younger girls formed hopes\\r\\nof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have\\r\\ndone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's\\r\\ndying an old maid.\", 'Charlotte herself was tolerably composed.', 'She had\\r\\ngained her point, and had time to consider of it.', 'Her reflections were\\r\\nin general satisfactory.', 'Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible\\r\\nnor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must\\r\\nbe imaginary.', 'But still he would be her husband.', 'Without thinking highly\\r\\neither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was\\r\\nthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,\\r\\nand however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest\\r\\npreservative from want.', 'This preservative she had now obtained; and at\\r\\nthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all\\r\\nthe good luck of it.', 'The least agreeable circumstance in the business\\r\\nwas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship\\r\\nshe valued beyond that of any other person.', 'Elizabeth would wonder,\\r\\nand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\\r\\nshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation.', 'She resolved\\r\\nto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\\r\\nwhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\\r\\npassed before any of the family.', 'A promise of secrecy was of course very\\r\\ndutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\\r\\ncuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\\r\\nquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\\r\\nat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\\r\\npublish his prosperous love.', 'As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the\\r\\nfamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved\\r\\nfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,\\r\\nsaid how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever\\r\\nhis engagements might allow him to visit them.', '\"My dear madam,\" he replied, \"this invitation is particularly\\r\\ngratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and\\r\\nyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\\r\\npossible.\"', 'They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\\r\\nso speedy a return, immediately said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine\\'s disapprobation here, my\\r\\ngood sir?', 'You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of\\r\\noffending your patroness.\"', '\"My dear sir,\" replied Mr. Collins, \"I am particularly obliged to you\\r\\nfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so\\r\\nmaterial a step without her ladyship\\'s concurrence.\"', '\"You cannot be too much upon your guard.', 'Risk anything rather than her\\r\\ndispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us\\r\\nagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,\\r\\nand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.\"', '\"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such\\r\\naffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive\\r\\nfrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your\\r\\nregard during my stay in Hertfordshire.', 'As for my fair cousins, though\\r\\nmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now\\r\\ntake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my\\r\\ncousin Elizabeth.\"', 'With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally\\r\\nsurprised that he meditated a quick return.', 'Mrs. Bennet wished to\\r\\nunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her\\r\\nyounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.', 'She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was\\r\\na solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no\\r\\nmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read\\r\\nand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very\\r\\nagreeable companion.', 'But on the following morning, every hope of this\\r\\nkind was done away.', 'Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\\r\\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.', 'The possibility of Mr. Collins\\'s fancying himself in love with her\\r\\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\\r\\nthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from\\r\\npossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was\\r\\nconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and\\r\\nshe could not help crying out:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins!', 'My dear Charlotte--impossible!\"', 'The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\\r\\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\\r\\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained\\r\\nher composure, and calmly replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?', 'Do you think it incredible\\r\\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\\'s good opinion,\\r\\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"', 'But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\\r\\nfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of\\r\\ntheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her\\r\\nall imaginable happiness.', '\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte.', '\"You must be surprised,\\r\\nvery much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry\\r\\nyou.', 'But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be\\r\\nsatisfied with what I have done.', 'I am not romantic, you know; I never\\r\\nwas.', 'I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\\'s\\r\\ncharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\\r\\nchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on\\r\\nentering the marriage state.\"', 'Elizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\" and after an awkward pause,\\r\\nthey returned to the rest of the family.', 'Charlotte did not stay much\\r\\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.', 'It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\\r\\nunsuitable a match.', \"The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\\r\\nof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now\\r\\naccepted.\", \"She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was\\r\\nnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible\\r\\nthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better\\r\\nfeeling to worldly advantage.\", 'Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a\\r\\nmost humiliating picture!', 'And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself\\r\\nand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it\\r\\nwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had\\r\\nchosen.', 'Chapter 23\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what\\r\\nshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention\\r\\nit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to\\r\\nannounce her engagement to the family.', 'With many compliments to them,\\r\\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\\r\\nhouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but\\r\\nincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,\\r\\nprotested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and\\r\\noften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good Lord!', 'Sir William, how can you tell such a story?', 'Do not you know\\r\\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"', \"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\\r\\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\\r\\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\\r\\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\\r\\nmost forbearing courtesy.\", 'Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\\r\\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\\r\\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\\r\\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters\\r\\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\\r\\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\\r\\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\\r\\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.', 'Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\\r\\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\\r\\nfound a rapid vent.', 'In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\\r\\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\\r\\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be\\r\\nhappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off.', 'Two\\r\\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\\r\\nElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she\\r\\nherself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two\\r\\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.', 'Nothing could\\r\\nconsole and nothing could appease her.', 'Nor did that day wear out her\\r\\nresentment.', 'A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\\r\\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\\r\\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\\r\\ncould at all forgive their daughter.', \"Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such\\r\\nas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for\\r\\nit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had\\r\\nbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and\\r\\nmore foolish than his daughter!\", 'Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said\\r\\nless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;\\r\\nnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.', 'Kitty\\r\\nand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a\\r\\nclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news\\r\\nto spread at Meryton.', \"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort\\r\\non Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she\\r\\ncalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,\\r\\nthough Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been\\r\\nenough to drive happiness away.\", 'Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them\\r\\nmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that\\r\\nno real confidence could ever subsist between them again.', 'Her\\r\\ndisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her\\r\\nsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could\\r\\nnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,\\r\\nas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his\\r\\nreturn.', 'Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting\\r\\nthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again.', \"The promised\\r\\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to\\r\\ntheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\\r\\ntwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted.\", 'After discharging\\r\\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\\r\\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\\r\\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\\r\\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\\r\\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\\r\\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\\r\\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\\r\\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\\r\\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\\r\\nthe happiest of men.', \"Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\\r\\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet.\", 'On the contrary, she was as much disposed to\\r\\ncomplain of it as her husband.', 'It was very strange that he should come\\r\\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\\r\\nand exceedingly troublesome.', 'She hated having visitors in the house\\r\\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\\r\\nmost disagreeable.', \"Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and\\r\\nthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued\\r\\nabsence.\", 'Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.', 'Day after\\r\\nday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the\\r\\nreport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to\\r\\nNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.\\r\\nBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous\\r\\nfalsehood.', 'Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that\\r\\nhis sisters would be successful in keeping him away.', \"Unwilling as\\r\\nshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\\r\\ndishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\\r\\nfrequently occurring.\", 'The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters\\r\\nand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss\\r\\nDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for\\r\\nthe strength of his attachment.', \"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more\\r\\npainful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of\\r\\nconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject\\r\\nwas never alluded to.\", 'But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,\\r\\nan hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her\\r\\nimpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he\\r\\ndid not come back she would think herself very ill used.', \"It needed\\r\\nall Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable\\r\\ntranquillity.\", 'Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his\\r\\nreception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his\\r\\nfirst introduction.', 'He was too happy, however, to need much attention;\\r\\nand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them\\r\\nfrom a great deal of his company.', 'The chief of every day was spent by\\r\\nhim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time\\r\\nto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.', 'Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state.', 'The very mention of\\r\\nanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,\\r\\nand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of.', 'The sight\\r\\nof Miss Lucas was odious to her.', 'As her successor in that house, she\\r\\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence.', 'Whenever Charlotte came to see\\r\\nthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\\r\\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\\r\\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\\r\\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead.', 'She\\r\\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.', '\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\\r\\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\\r\\nmake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\"', '\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts.', 'Let us hope for\\r\\nbetter things.', 'Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.\"', 'This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of\\r\\nmaking any answer, she went on as before.', '\"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate.', 'If it was\\r\\nnot for the entail, I should not mind it.\"', '\"What should not you mind?\"', '\"I should not mind anything at all.\"', '\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\\r\\ninsensibility.\"', '\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail.', \"How\\r\\nanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own\\r\\ndaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!\", 'Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\"', '\"I leave it to yourself to determine,\" said Mr. Bennet.', \"Chapter 24\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt.\", \"The very first\\r\\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\\r\\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\\r\\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\\r\\nthe country.\", 'Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest\\r\\nof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\\r\\nwriter, that could give her any comfort.', \"Miss Darcy's praise occupied\\r\\nthe chief of it.\", 'Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline\\r\\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\\r\\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\\r\\nletter.', \"She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\\r\\ninmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\\r\\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\", 'Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\\r\\nheard it in silent indignation.', 'Her heart was divided between concern\\r\\nfor her sister, and resentment against all others.', \"To Caroline's\\r\\nassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no\\r\\ncredit.\", 'That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\\r\\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\\r\\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\\r\\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\\r\\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness\\r\\nto the caprice of their inclination.', \"Had his own happiness, however,\\r\\nbeen the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\\r\\nwhatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as\\r\\nshe thought he must be sensible himself.\", 'It was a subject, in short,\\r\\non which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing.', \"She\\r\\ncould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really\\r\\ndied away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether\\r\\nhe had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his\\r\\nobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be\\r\\nmaterially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained\\r\\nthe same, her peace equally wounded.\", 'A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to\\r\\nElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet\\'s leaving them together, after a\\r\\nlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could\\r\\nnot help saying:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself!', 'She can have no\\r\\nidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him.', 'But\\r\\nI will not repine.', 'It cannot last long.', 'He will be forgot, and we shall\\r\\nall be as we were before.\"', 'Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\\r\\nnothing.', '\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you have\\r\\nno reason.', 'He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\\r\\nacquaintance, but that is all.', 'I have nothing either to hope or fear,\\r\\nand nothing to reproach him with.', 'Thank God!', 'I have not _that_ pain.', 'A\\r\\nlittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.\"', 'With a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\\r\\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\\r\\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.\"', '\"My dear Jane!\"', 'exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good.', 'Your sweetness\\r\\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say\\r\\nto you.', 'I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\\r\\ndeserve.\"', \"Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\\r\\nthe praise on her sister's warm affection.\", '\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair.', '_You_ wish to think all the\\r\\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.', 'I only want\\r\\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it.', 'Do not\\r\\nbe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\\r\\nprivilege of universal good-will.', 'You need not.', 'There are few people\\r\\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well.', 'The more I see\\r\\nof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\\r\\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\\r\\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or\\r\\nsense.', \"I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the\\r\\nother is Charlotte's marriage.\", 'It is unaccountable!', 'In every view it is\\r\\nunaccountable!\"', '\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these.', 'They will\\r\\nruin your happiness.', 'You do not make allowance enough for difference\\r\\nof situation and temper.', \"Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\\r\\nCharlotte's steady, prudent character.\", 'Remember that she is one of a\\r\\nlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be\\r\\nready to believe, for everybody\\'s sake, that she may feel something like\\r\\nregard and esteem for our cousin.\"', '\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\\r\\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\\r\\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\\r\\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart.', 'My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\\r\\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as\\r\\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him\\r\\ncannot have a proper way of thinking.', 'You shall not defend her, though\\r\\nit is Charlotte Lucas.', 'You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\\r\\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\\r\\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\\r\\ndanger security for happiness.\"', '\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied\\r\\nJane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy\\r\\ntogether.', 'But enough of this.', 'You alluded to something else.', 'You\\r\\nmentioned _two_ instances.', 'I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\\r\\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\\r\\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk.', 'We must not be so ready to fancy\\r\\nourselves intentionally injured.', 'We must not expect a lively young man\\r\\nto be always so guarded and circumspect.', 'It is very often nothing but\\r\\nour own vanity that deceives us.', 'Women fancy admiration means more than\\r\\nit does.\"', '\"And men take care that they should.\"', '\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\\r\\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"', '\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley\\'s conduct to design,\"\\r\\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\\r\\nunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.', 'Thoughtlessness,\\r\\nwant of attention to other people\\'s feelings, and want of resolution,\\r\\nwill do the business.\"', '\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"', '\"Yes; to the last.', 'But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what\\r\\nI think of persons you esteem.', \"'What for?'\", 'said Alice.', '\\'Did you say \"What a pity!\"?\\'', 'the Rabbit asked.', \"'No, I didn't,' said Alice: 'I don't think it's at all a pity.\", 'I said\\r\\n\"What for?\"\\'', \"'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.\", 'Alice gave a little\\r\\nscream of laughter.', \"'Oh, hush!'\", 'the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\r\\ntone.', \"'The Queen will hear you!\", \"You see, she came rather late, and the\\r\\nQueen said--'\\r\\n\\r\\n'Get to your places!'\", 'shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\r\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\r\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\r\\nbegan.', 'Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\\r\\nher life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\\r\\nthe mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\\r\\nup and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.', 'The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\r\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\\r\\nher arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\\r\\nits neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\\r\\nblow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\\r\\nwith such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\\r\\nlaughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\\r\\nagain, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\\r\\nitself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\\r\\ngenerally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\\r\\nhedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\\r\\nand walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\\r\\nconclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.', \"The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\r\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\\r\\ntime the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\r\\nshouting 'Off with his head!'\", \"or 'Off with her head!'\", 'about once in a\\r\\nminute.', \"Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\r\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\r\\n'and then,' thought she, 'what would become of me?\", \"They're dreadfully\\r\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one\\r\\nleft alive!'\", \"She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\r\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\\r\\nin the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\\r\\na minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\\r\\n'It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.'\", \"'How are you getting on?'\", 'said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\r\\nenough for it to speak with.', 'Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.', \"'It's no use\\r\\nspeaking to it,' she thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one\\r\\nof them.'\", 'In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\r\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\r\\nshe had someone to listen to her.', 'The Cat seemed to think that there was\\r\\nenough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.', \"'I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather a\\r\\ncomplaining tone, 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\\r\\noneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular;\\r\\nat least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea how\\r\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\\r\\narch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\r\\nground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\\r\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!'\", \"'How do you like the Queen?'\", 'said the Cat in a low voice.', \"'Not at all,' said Alice: 'she's so extremely--' Just then she noticed\\r\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\r\\n'--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'\", 'The Queen smiled and passed on.', \"'Who ARE you talking to?'\", \"said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\\r\\nat the Cat's head with great curiosity.\", \"'It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: 'allow me to\\r\\nintroduce it.'\", \"'I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: 'however, it may\\r\\nkiss my hand if it likes.'\", \"'I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.\", \"'Don't be impertinent,' said the King, 'and don't look at me like that!'\", 'He got behind Alice as he spoke.', \"'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.\", \"'I've read that in some book,\\r\\nbut I don't remember where.'\", \"'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called\\r\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear!\", \"I wish you would\\r\\nhave this cat removed!'\", 'The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.', \"'Off with his head!'\", 'she said, without even looking round.', \"'I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and he\\r\\nhurried off.\", \"Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\r\\non, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\\r\\npassion.\", 'She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\r\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\r\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\r\\nwhether it was her turn or not.', 'So she went in search of her hedgehog.', 'The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\r\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\r\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\\r\\nother side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\\r\\nsort of way to fly up into a tree.', \"By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\r\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't\\r\\nmatter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side\\r\\nof the ground.'\", 'So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\r\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\r\\nfriend.', 'When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\\r\\nlarge crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\r\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\r\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.', 'The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\r\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\r\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\r\\nwhat they said.', \"The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\\r\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\r\\nthing before, and he wasn't going to begin at HIS time of life.\", \"The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\r\\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\", \"The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less\\r\\nthan no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.\", '(It was this last\\r\\nremark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)', \"Alice could think of nothing else to say but 'It belongs to the Duchess:\\r\\nyou'd better ask HER about it.'\", \"'She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: 'fetch her here.'\", 'And the executioner went off like an arrow.', \"The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\\r\\nby the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\\r\\ndisappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down\\r\\nlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\", 'CHAPTER IX.', \"The Mock Turtle's Story\\r\\n\\r\\n'You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!'\", \"said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's, and\\r\\nthey walked off together.\", 'Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\r\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\r\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.', \"'When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone\\r\\nthough), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL.\", \"Soup does very\\r\\nwell without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'\\r\\nshe went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\\r\\nrule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes\\r\\nthem bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\r\\nsweet-tempered.\", \"I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so\\r\\nstingy about it, you know--'\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\r\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear.\", \"'You're thinking\\r\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk.\", \"I can't\\r\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\r\\na bit.'\", \"'Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.\", \"'Tut, tut, child!'\", 'said the Duchess.', \"'Everything's got a moral, if only\\r\\nyou can find it.'\", \"And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\\r\\nshe spoke.\", \"Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\r\\nDuchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\r\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\\r\\nuncomfortably sharp chin.\", 'However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\r\\nbore it as well as she could.', \"'The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up\\r\\nthe conversation a little.\", '\\'\\'Tis so,\\' said the Duchess: \\'and the moral of that is--\"Oh, \\'tis love,\\r\\n\\'tis love, that makes the world go round!\"\\'', \"'Somebody said,' Alice whispered, 'that it's done by everybody minding\\r\\ntheir own business!'\", \"'Ah, well!\", 'It means much the same thing,\\' said the Duchess, digging her\\r\\nsharp little chin into Alice\\'s shoulder as she added, \\'and the moral\\r\\nof THAT is--\"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\r\\nthemselves.\"\\'', \"'How fond she is of finding morals in things!'\", 'Alice thought to herself.', \"'I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,'\\r\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: 'the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\\r\\nthe temper of your flamingo.\", \"Shall I try the experiment?'\", \"'HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\\r\\nhave the experiment tried.\", \"'Very true,' said the Duchess: 'flamingoes and mustard both bite.\", 'And\\r\\nthe moral of that is--\"Birds of a feather flock together.\"\\'', \"'Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.\", \"'Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: 'what a clear way you have of\\r\\nputting things!'\", \"'It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.\", \"'Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\r\\neverything that Alice said; 'there's a large mustard-mine near here.\", 'And\\r\\nthe moral of that is--\"The more there is of mine, the less there is of\\r\\nyours.\"\\'', \"'Oh, I know!'\", \"exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\\r\\n'it's a vegetable.\", \"It doesn't look like one, but it is.'\", '\\'I quite agree with you,\\' said the Duchess; \\'and the moral of that\\r\\nis--\"Be what you would seem to be\"--or if you\\'d like it put more\\r\\nsimply--\"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\r\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\\r\\nthan what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.\"\\'', \"'I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very politely, 'if\\r\\nI had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'\", \"'That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess replied, in\\r\\na pleased tone.\", \"'Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,' said\\r\\nAlice.\", \"'Oh, don't talk about trouble!'\", 'said the Duchess.', \"'I make you a present\\r\\nof everything I've said as yet.'\", \"'A cheap sort of present!'\", 'thought Alice.', \"'I'm glad they don't give\\r\\nbirthday presents like that!'\", 'But she did not venture to say it out\\r\\nloud.', \"'Thinking again?'\", 'the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\r\\nlittle chin.', \"'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\r\\nfeel a little worried.\", \"'Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, 'as pigs have to fly; and\\r\\nthe m--'\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even\\r\\nin the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was linked\\r\\ninto hers began to tremble.\", 'Alice looked up,

choice, and was gone in a moment.', \"'Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\\r\\ntoo much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\r\\ncroquet-ground.\", \"The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were\\r\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\r\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would\\r\\ncost them their lives.\", \"All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\\r\\nthe other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!'\", \"or 'Off with her\\r\\nhead!'\", 'Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\\r\\nwho of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\\r\\nthe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\\r\\nplayers, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\\r\\nunder sentence of execution.', \"Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, 'Have\\r\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\", \"'No,' said Alice.\", \"'I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'\", \"'It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.\", \"'I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.\", \"'Come on, then,' said the Queen, 'and he shall tell you his history,'\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\r\\nto the company generally, 'You are all pardoned.'\", \"'Come, THAT'S a good\\r\\nthing!'\", 'she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\r\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.', 'They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.', \"(IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)\", \"'Up, lazy\\r\\nthing!'\", \"said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock\\r\\nTurtle, and to hear his history.\", \"I must go back and see after some\\r\\nexecutions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\\r\\nthe Gryphon.\", 'Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\\r\\nthe whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\\r\\nafter that savage Queen: so she waited.', 'The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\r\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled.', \"'What fun!'\", 'said the Gryphon,\\r\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.', \"'What IS the fun?'\", 'said Alice.', \"'Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.\", \"'It's all her fancy, that: they never\\r\\nexecutes nobody, you know.\", \"Come on!'\", '\\'Everybody says \"come on!\"', \"here,' thought Alice, as she went slowly\\r\\nafter it: 'I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'\", 'They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\r\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\r\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.', 'She\\r\\npitied him deeply.', \"'What is his sorrow?'\", \"she asked the Gryphon, and the\\r\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, 'It's all his\\r\\nfancy, that: he hasn't got no sorrow, you know.\", \"Come on!'\", 'So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\r\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.', \"'This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, 'she wants for to know your\\r\\nhistory, she do.'\", \"'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit\\r\\ndown, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'\", 'So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.', \"Alice thought to\\r\\nherself, 'I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn't begin.'\", 'But\\r\\nshe waited patiently.', \"'Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, 'I was a real\\r\\nTurtle.'\", \"These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\r\\noccasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!'\", 'from the Gryphon, and the constant\\r\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.', \"Alice was very nearly getting up and\\r\\nsaying, 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' but she could\\r\\nnot help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\\r\\nnothing.\", \"'When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\r\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, 'we went to school in the\\r\\nsea.\", \"The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--'\\r\\n\\r\\n'Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?'\", 'Alice asked.', \"'We called him Tortoise because he

Turtle.\", \"'Hold your tongue!'\", 'added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.', 'The Mock Turtle went on.', \"'We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every

learned French and music.'\", \"'And washing?'\", 'said the Mock Turtle.', \"'Certainly not!'\", 'said Alice indignantly.', \"'Ah!\", \"then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in\\r\\na tone of great relief.\", '\\'Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\\r\\n\"French, music, AND WASHING--extra.\"\\'', \"'You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; 'living at the bottom of\\r\\nthe sea.'\", \"'I couldn't afford to learn it.'\", 'said the Mock Turtle with a sigh.', \"'I\\r\\nonly took the regular course.'\", \"'What was that?'\", 'inquired Alice.', \"'Reeling

to beautify is, I suppose?'\", \"'Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: 'it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'\", \"'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is,\\r\\nyou ARE a simpleton.'\", \"Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\\r\\nturned to the Mock Turtle, and said 'What else had you to learn?'\", \"'Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\\r\\nthe subjects on his flappers, '--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\r\\nSeaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\r\\nthat used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\r\\nFainting in Coils.'\", \"'What was THAT like?'\", 'said Alice.', \"'Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: 'I'm too\\r\\nstiff.\", \"And the Gryphon never learnt it.'\", \"'Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: 'I went to the Classics master, though.\", \"He was an old crab, HE was.'\", \"'I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: 'he taught\\r\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.'\", \"'So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\r\\ncreatures hid their faces in

minute or\\r\\ntwo sobs choked his voice.', \"'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,'\\r\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\r\\nthe back.\", \"At last the Mock

growing.'\", \"'You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.\", \"'Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: 'you know you're growing\\r\\ntoo.'\", \"'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that\\r\\nridiculous fashion.'\", 'And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\\r\\nother side of the court.', \"All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\r\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\r\\nof the court, 'Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!'\", 'on\\r\\nwhich the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.', \"'Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, 'or I'll have you\\r\\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.'\", \"'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\r\\n'--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\\r\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'\\r\\n\\r\\n'The twinkling of the what?'\", 'said the King.', \"'It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.\", \"'Of course twinkling begins with a T!'\", 'said the King sharply.', \"'Do you\\r\\ntake me for a dunce?\", \"Go on!'\", \"'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after\\r\\nthat--only the March Hare said--'\\r\\n\\r\\n'I didn't!'\", 'the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.', \"'You did!'\", 'said the Hatter.', \"'I deny it!'\", 'said the March Hare.', \"'He denies it,' said the King: 'leave out that part.'\", \"'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking\\r\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\r\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\", \"'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread-and-butter--'\\r\\n\\r\\n'But what did the Dormouse say?'\", 'one of the jury asked.', \"'That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.\", \"'You MUST remember,' remarked the King, 'or I'll have you executed.'\", 'The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\r\\ndown on one knee.', \"'I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he began.\", \"'You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.\", 'Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\r\\nthe officers of the court.', '(As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\r\\nexplain to you how it was done.', 'They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\r\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\r\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)', \"'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.\", '\\'I\\'ve so often read\\r\\nin the newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts\\r\\nat applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\r\\ncourt,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.\\'', \"'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the\\r\\nKing.\", \"'I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: 'I'm on the floor, as it is.'\", \"'Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.\", 'Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.', \"'Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!'\", 'thought Alice.', \"'Now we shall get\\r\\non better.'\", \"'I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the\\r\\nQueen, who was reading the list of singers.\", \"'You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\r\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\r\\n\\r\\n'\", \"--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the\\r\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\r\\nto the door.\", \"'Call the next witness!'\", 'said the King.', \"The next witness was the Duchess's cook.\", 'She carried the pepper-box in\\r\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\r\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.', \"'Give your evidence,' said the King.\", \"'Shan't,' said the cook.\", \"The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\r\\n'Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'\", \"'Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\r\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\r\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, 'What are tarts made of?'\", \"'Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.\", \"'Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.\", \"'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.\", \"'Behead that Dormouse!\", 'Turn that Dormouse out of court!', 'Suppress him!', 'Pinch him!', \"Off with his\\r\\nwhiskers!'\", 'For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\r\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\r\\ndisappeared.', \"'Never mind!'\", 'said the King, with an air of great relief.', \"'Call the next\\r\\nwitness.'\", \"And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear,\\r\\nYOU must cross-examine the next witness.\", \"It quite makes my forehead\\r\\nache!'\", \"Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very\\r\\ncurious to see what the next witness would be like, '--for they haven't\\r\\ngot much evidence YET,' she said to herself.\", \"Imagine her surprise, when\\r\\nthe White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the\\r\\nname 'Alice!'\", 'CHAPTER XII.', \"Alice's Evidence\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'Here!'\", 'cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\r\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\r\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\r\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\r\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\\r\\nshe had accidentally upset the week before.', \"'Oh, I BEG your pardon!'\", 'she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\r\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\\r\\nthe goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\\r\\nthat they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\\r\\nthey would die.', \"'The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave voice, 'until\\r\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,' he repeated with\\r\\ngreat emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\", 'Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\r\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\r\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.', \"She soon got\\r\\nit out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said\\r\\nto herself; 'I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\\r\\none way up as the other.'\", 'As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\r\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\r\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\r\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\r\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\r\\ncourt.', \"'What do you know about this business?'\", 'the King said to Alice.', \"'Nothing,' said Alice.\", \"'Nothing WHATEVER?'\", 'persisted the King.', \"'Nothing whatever,' said Alice.\", \"'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.\", \"They were\\r\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\\r\\ninterrupted: 'UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a\\r\\nvery respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\", \"'UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on\\r\\nto himself in an undertone,\\r\\n\\r\\n'important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying\\r\\nwhich word sounded best.\", \"Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'\", \"Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\r\\n'but it doesn't matter a bit,' she thought to herself.\", \"At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\r\\nhis note-book, cackled out 'Silence!'\", \"and read out from his book, 'Rule\\r\\nForty-two.\", \"ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'\", 'Everybody looked at Alice.', \"'I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.\", \"'You are,' said the King.\", \"'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.\", \"'Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: 'besides, that's not a\\r\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.'\", \"'It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.\", \"'Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.\", 'The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.', \"'Consider your\\r\\nverdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\", \"'There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said the White\\r\\nRabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; 'this paper has just been picked\\r\\nup.'\", \"'What's in it?'\", 'said the Queen.', \"'I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, 'but it seems to be a\\r\\nletter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'\", \"'It must have been that,' said the King, 'unless it was written to\\r\\nnobody, which isn't usual, you know.'\", \"'Who is it directed to?'\", 'said one of the jurymen.', \"'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's\\r\\nnothing written on the OUTSIDE.'\", \"He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and\\r\\nadded 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'\", \"'Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?'\", 'asked another of the jurymen.', \"'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing\\r\\nabout it.'\", '(The jury all looked puzzled.)', \"'He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.\", '(The jury\\r\\nall brightened up again.)', \"'Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, 'I didn't write it, and they\\r\\ncan't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'\", \"'If you didn't sign it,' said the King, 'that only makes the matter\\r\\nworse.\", \"You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your\\r\\nname like an honest man.'\", 'There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\r\\nclever thing the King had said that day.', \"'That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.\", \"'It proves nothing of the sort!'\", 'said Alice.', \"'Why, you don't even know\\r\\nwhat they're about!'\", \"'Read them,' said the King.\", 'The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.', \"'Where shall I begin, please\\r\\nyour Majesty?'\", 'he asked.', \"'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you\\r\\ncome to the end: then stop.'\", \"These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\\r\\n\\r\\n   'They told me you had been to her,\\r\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\r\\n   She gave me a good character,\\r\\n    But said I could not swim.\", 'He sent them word I had not gone\\r\\n    (We know it to be true):\\r\\n   If she should push the matter on,\\r\\n    What would become of you?', 'I gave her one, they gave him two,\\r\\n    You gave us three or more;\\r\\n   They all returned from him to you,\\r\\n    Though they were mine before.', 'If I or she should chance to be\\r\\n    Involved in this affair,\\r\\n   He trusts to you to set them free,\\r\\n    Exactly as we were.', 'My notion was that you had been\\r\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\r\\n   An obstacle that came between\\r\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.', \"Don't let him know she liked them best,\\r\\n    For this must ever be\\r\\n   A secret, kept from all the rest,\\r\\n    Between yourself and me.'\", \"'That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the\\r\\nKing, rubbing his hands; 'so now let the jury--'\\r\\n\\r\\n'If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had grown so large\\r\\nin the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting\\r\\nhim,) 'I'll give him sixpence.\", \"_I_ don't believe there's an atom of\\r\\nmeaning in it.'\", \"The jury all wrote down on their slates, 'SHE doesn't believe there's an\\r\\natom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\", \"'If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, 'that saves a world of\\r\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.\", 'And yet I don\\'t know,\\'\\r\\nhe went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them\\r\\nwith one eye; \\'I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \"', '--SAID\\r\\nI COULD NOT SWIM--\" you can\\'t swim, can you?\\'', 'he added, turning to the\\r\\nKnave.', 'The Knave shook his head sadly.', \"'Do I look like it?'\", 'he said.', '(Which he\\r\\ncertainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)', '\\'All right, so far,\\' said the King, and he went on muttering over\\r\\nthe verses to himself: \\'\"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\" that\\'s the jury, of\\r\\ncourse--\"I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\" why, that must be what he\\r\\ndid with the tarts, you know--\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\'But, it goes on \"THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\"\\' said Alice.', \"'Why, there they are!'\", 'said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts\\r\\non the table.', \"'Nothing can be clearer than THAT.\", 'Then again--\"BEFORE SHE\\r\\nHAD THIS FIT--\" you never had fits, my dear, I think?\\'', 'he said to the\\r\\nQueen.', \"'Never!'\", 'said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\r\\nas she spoke.', '(The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\r\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\r\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as\\r\\nit lasted.)', \"'Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court\\r\\nwith a smile.\", 'There was a dead silence.', \"'It's a pun!'\", \"the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\\r\\n'Let the jury consider their verdict,' the King said, for about the\\r\\ntwentieth time that day.\", \"'No, no!'\", 'said the Queen.', \"'Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'\", \"'Stuff and nonsense!'\", 'said Alice loudly.', \"'The idea of having the\\r\\nsentence first!'\", \"'Hold your tongue!'\", 'said the Queen, turning purple.', \"'I won't!'\", 'said Alice.', \"'Off with her head!'\", 'the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.', 'Nobody\\r\\nmoved.', \"'Who cares for you?'\", 'said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\\r\\ntime.)', \"'You're nothing but a pack of cards!'\", 'At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\r\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\r\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\r\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\r\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.', \"'Wake up, Alice dear!'\", \"said her sister; 'Why, what a long sleep you've\\r\\nhad!'\", \"'Oh, I've had such a curious dream!'\", \"said Alice, and she told her\\r\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures\\r\\nof hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\\r\\nfinished, her sister kissed her, and said, 'It WAS a curious dream,\\r\\ndear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.'\", 'So\\r\\nAlice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\r\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.', \"But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\r\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\\r\\nwonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\\r\\nthis was her dream:--\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\r\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\\r\\nup into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\\r\\nqueer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\\r\\nWOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\\r\\nlisten, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\\r\\nof her little sister's dream.\", \"The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\\r\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\\r\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\r\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\r\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\\r\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\r\\naround it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\r\\nLizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\r\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\r\\nTurtle.\", \"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\r\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\r\\nwould change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\\r\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\\r\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill\\r\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\\r\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\\r\\nknew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\\r\\nof the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's\\r\\nheavy sobs.\", 'Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\r\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\r\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\r\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\\r\\nmake THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\\r\\nwith the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\\r\\nall their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\\r\\nremembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.', \"THE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project

and shape.', 'All of them had green glasses in\\r\\nthem.', 'The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\\r\\nDorothy and put them over her eyes.', 'There were two golden bands\\r\\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\\r\\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\\r\\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck.', 'When they were on, Dorothy\\r\\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\\r\\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.', 'Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\\r\\nwith the key.', 'Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\\r\\nwas ready to show them to the Palace.', 'Taking a big golden key from a\\r\\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\\r\\nthrough the

the brilliancy of the wonderful City.', 'The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble\\r\\nand studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds.', 'They walked over a\\r\\npavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined\\r\\ntogether were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the\\r\\nbrightness of the sun.', 'The window panes were of green glass; even the\\r\\nsky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.', 'There were many people--men, women, and children--walking about, and\\r\\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins.', 'They\\r\\nlooked at Dorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering\\r\\neyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when\\r\\nthey saw the Lion; but no one spoke to them.', 'Many shops stood in the\\r\\nstreet, and Dorothy saw that everything in them was green.', 'Green candy\\r\\nand green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green\\r\\nhats, and green clothes of all sorts.', 'At one place a man was selling\\r\\ngreen lemonade, and when the children bought it Dorothy could see that\\r\\nthey paid for it with green pennies.', 'There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried\\r\\nthings around in little green carts, which they pushed before them.', 'Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.', 'The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came\\r\\nto a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the\\r\\nPalace of Oz, the Great Wizard.', 'There was a soldier before the door,\\r\\ndressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.', '\"Here are strangers,\" said the Guardian of the Gates to him, \"and they\\r\\ndemand to see the Great Oz.\"', '\"Step inside,\" answered the soldier, \"and I will carry your message to\\r\\nhim.\"', 'So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room\\r\\nwith a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds.', 'The\\r\\nsoldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering\\r\\nthis room, and when they were seated he said politely:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the\\r\\nThrone Room and tell Oz you are here.\"', 'They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned.', 'When, at\\r\\nlast, he came back, Dorothy asked:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Have you seen Oz?\"', '\"Oh, no,\" returned the soldier; \"I have never seen him.', 'But I spoke to\\r\\nhim as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message.', 'He said he\\r\\nwill grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must\\r\\nenter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day.', 'Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will\\r\\nhave you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your\\r\\njourney.\"', '\"Thank you,\" replied the girl; \"that is very kind of Oz.\"', 'The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl,\\r\\ndressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room.', 'She had lovely\\r\\ngreen hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she\\r\\nsaid, \"Follow me and I will show you your room.\"', 'So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the\\r\\ndog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up\\r\\nthree flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the\\r\\nPalace.', 'It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft\\r\\ncomfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet\\r\\ncounterpane.', 'There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that\\r\\nshot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a\\r\\nbeautifully carved green marble basin.', 'Beautiful green flowers stood\\r\\nin the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.', 'When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\\r\\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.', 'In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\\r\\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.', '\"Make yourself perfectly at home,\" said the green girl, \"and if you\\r\\nwish for anything ring the bell.', 'Oz will send for you tomorrow\\r\\nmorning.\"', 'She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others.', 'These she also led\\r\\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\\r\\npart of the Palace.', 'Of course this politeness was wasted on the\\r\\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\\r\\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning.', 'It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so\\r\\nhe remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its\\r\\nweb in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\\r\\nwonderful rooms in the world.', 'The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\\r\\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\\r\\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\\r\\nto make sure they kept in good working order.', 'The Lion would have\\r\\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\\r\\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\\r\\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\\r\\nhimself asleep in a minute.', 'The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\\r\\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\\r\\ngreen brocaded satin.', \"Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\\r\\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\\r\\nof the Great Oz.\", 'First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\\r\\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes.', 'These people had nothing\\r\\nto do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\\r\\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\\r\\nOz.', 'As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\\r\\nwhispered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"', '\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"', '\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\\r\\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.', 'Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\\r\\ncame from.', 'Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\\r\\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested.', 'At last I told him\\r\\nabout the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to\\r\\nhis presence.\"', 'Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\\r\\nsignal.', 'You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"', 'She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\\r\\nherself in a wonderful place.', 'It was a big, round room with a high\\r\\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\\r\\nlarge emeralds set closely together.', 'In the center of the roof was a\\r\\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\\r\\nwonderful manner.', 'But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\\r\\nthat stood in the middle of the room.', 'It was shaped like a chair and\\r\\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else.', 'In the center of the chair\\r\\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\\r\\nwhatever.', 'There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\\r\\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.', 'As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\\r\\nand looked at her sharply and steadily.', 'Then the mouth moved, and\\r\\nDorothy heard a voice say:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.', 'Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"', 'It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\\r\\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek.', 'I have come to you for help.\"', 'The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute.', 'Then said the\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"', '\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\\r\\nher and killed her,\" she replied.', '\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\"', 'continued the voice.', '\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\r\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.', 'Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\\r\\ntruth.', 'Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"', '\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\\r\\nanswered earnestly.', '\"I don\\'t like your country, although it is so\\r\\nbeautiful.', 'And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\\r\\nbeing away so long.\"', 'The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\\r\\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\\r\\nevery part of the room.', 'And at last they looked at Dorothy again.', '\"Why should I do this for you?\"', 'asked Oz.', '\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\\r\\nand I am only a little girl.\"', '\"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\" said\\r\\nOz.', '\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy simply; \"I could not help it.\"', '\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer.', 'You have no right\\r\\nto expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me\\r\\nin return.', 'In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets.', 'If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\\r\\nsomething for me first.', 'Help me and I will help you.\"', '\"What must I do?\"', 'asked the girl.', '\"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.', '\"But I cannot!\"', 'exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.', '\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\\r\\nbear a powerful charm.', 'There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\\r\\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\\r\\nKansas--but not before.\"', 'The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\\r\\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\\r\\nfelt that she could help him if she would.', '\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed.', '\"Even if I wanted\\r\\nto, how could I kill the Wicked Witch?', 'If you, who are Great and\\r\\nTerrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"', '\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\\r\\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again.', 'Remember\\r\\nthat the Witch is Wicked--tremendously Wicked--and ought to be killed.', 'Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"', 'Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion\\r\\nand the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had\\r\\nsaid to her.', '\"There is no hope for me,\" she said sadly, \"for Oz will\\r\\nnot send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and\\r\\nthat I can never do.\"', 'Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy\\r\\nwent to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.', 'The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the\\r\\nScarecrow and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.\"', 'So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne\\r\\nRoom, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady.', 'She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green\\r\\nlocks a crown of jewels.', 'Growing from her shoulders were wings,\\r\\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\\r\\nbreath of air reached them.', 'When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\\r\\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.', 'Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"', 'Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\\r\\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.', '\"I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw.', 'Therefore I have no\\r\\nbrains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head\\r\\ninstead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in\\r\\nyour dominions.\"', '\"Why should I do this for you?\"', 'asked the Lady.', '\"Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,\"\\r\\nanswered the Scarecrow.', '\"I never grant favors without some return,\" said Oz; \"but this much I\\r\\nwill promise.', 'If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I\\r\\nwill bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you\\r\\nwill be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.\"', '\"I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,\" said the Scarecrow, in\\r\\nsurprise.', '\"So I did.', \"I don't care who kills her.\", 'But until she is dead I will\\r\\nnot grant your wish.', 'Now go, and do not seek me again until you have\\r\\nearned the brains you so greatly desire.\"', 'The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what\\r\\nOz had said; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard\\r\\nwas not a Head, as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.', '\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"she needs a heart as much as the\\r\\nTin Woodman.\"', 'On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oz has sent for you.', 'Follow me.\"', 'So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room.', 'He\\r\\ndid not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he\\r\\nhoped it would be the lovely Lady.', '\"For,\" he said to himself, \"if it\\r\\nis the head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has\\r\\nno heart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me.', 'But if it is the\\r\\nlovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves\\r\\nsaid to be kindly hearted.\"', 'But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the\\r\\nHead nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.', 'It was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly\\r\\nstrong enough to hold its weight.', 'The Beast had a head like that of a\\r\\nrhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face.', 'There were five\\r\\nlong arms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim\\r\\nlegs.', 'Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more\\r\\ndreadful-looking monster could not be imagined.', 'It was fortunate the\\r\\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud\\r\\nand fast from terror.', 'But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all\\r\\nafraid, although he was much disappointed.', '\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" spoke the Beast, in a voice that was\\r\\none great roar.', '\"Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"', '\"I am a Woodman, and made of tin.', 'Therefore I have no heart, and\\r\\ncannot love.', 'I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men\\r\\nare.\"', '\"Why should I do this?\"', 'demanded the Beast.', '\"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,\" answered the\\r\\nWoodman.', 'Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: \"If you indeed desire a\\r\\nheart, you must earn it.\"', '\"How?\"', 'asked the Woodman.', '\"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" replied the Beast.', '\"When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\\r\\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.\"', 'So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and\\r\\ntell them of the terrible Beast he had seen.', 'They all wondered greatly\\r\\nat the many forms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the\\r\\nLion said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so\\r\\nfrighten him that he will grant all I ask.', 'And if he is the lovely\\r\\nLady, I shall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my\\r\\nbidding.', 'And if he is the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I\\r\\nwill roll this head all about the room until he promises to give us\\r\\nwhat we desire.', 'So be of good cheer, my friends, for all will yet be\\r\\nwell.\"', 'The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to\\r\\nthe great Throne Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.', 'The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to\\r\\nhis surprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and\\r\\nglowing he could scarcely bear to gaze upon it.', 'His first thought was\\r\\nthat Oz had by accident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he\\r\\ntried to go nearer, the heat was so intense that it singed his\\r\\nwhiskers, and he crept back tremblingly to a spot nearer the door.', 'Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the\\r\\nwords it spoke:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.', 'Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"', 'And the Lion answered, \"I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything.', 'I\\r\\ncame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may\\r\\nbecome the King of Beasts, as men call me.\"', '\"Why should I give you courage?\"', 'demanded Oz.', '\"Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to\\r\\ngrant my request,\" answered the Lion.', 'The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, \"Bring\\r\\nme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you\\r\\ncourage.', 'But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.\"', 'The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and\\r\\nwhile he stood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so\\r\\nfuriously hot that he turned tail and rushed from the room.', 'He was\\r\\nglad to find his friends waiting for him, and told them of his terrible\\r\\ninterview with the Wizard.', '\"What shall we do now?\"', 'asked Dorothy sadly.', '\"There is only one thing we can do,\" returned the Lion, \"and that is to\\r\\ngo to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and destroy\\r\\nher.\"', '\"But suppose we cannot?\"', 'said the girl.', '\"Then I shall never have courage,\" declared the Lion.', '\"And I shall never have brains,\" added the Scarecrow.', '\"And I shall never have a heart,\" spoke the Tin Woodman.', '\"And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,\" said Dorothy,\\r\\nbeginning to cry.', '\"Be careful!\"', 'cried the green girl.', '\"The tears will fall on your green\\r\\nsilk gown and spot it.\"', 'So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, \"I suppose we must try it; but I am\\r\\nsure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.\"', '\"I will go with you; but I\\'m too much of a coward to kill the Witch,\"\\r\\nsaid the Lion.', '\"I will go too,\" declared the Scarecrow; \"but I shall not be of much\\r\\nhelp to you, I am such a fool.\"', '\"I haven\\'t the heart to harm even a Witch,\" remarked the Tin Woodman;\\r\\n\"but if you go I certainly shall go with you.\"', 'Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning,\\r\\nand the Woodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his\\r\\njoints properly oiled.', 'The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw\\r\\nand Dorothy put new paint on his eyes that he might see better.', \"The\\r\\ngreen girl, who was very kind to them, filled Dorothy's basket with\\r\\ngood things to eat, and fastened a little bell around Toto's neck with\\r\\na green ribbon.\", 'They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when\\r\\nthey were awakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the\\r\\nback yard of the Palace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a\\r\\ngreen egg.', '12.', 'The Search for the Wicked Witch\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the\\r\\nEmerald City until they reached the room where the Guardian of the\\r\\nGates lived.', 'This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back\\r\\nin his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.', '\"Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"There is no road,\" answered the Guardian of the Gates.', '\"No one ever\\r\\nwishes to go that way.\"', '\"How, then, are we to find her?\"', 'inquired the girl.', '\"That will be easy,\" replied the man, \"for when she knows you are in\\r\\nthe country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her\\r\\nslaves.\"', '\"Perhaps not,\" said the Scarecrow, \"for we mean to destroy her.\"', '\"Oh, that is different,\" said the Guardian of the Gates.', '\"No one has\\r\\never destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves\\r\\nof you, as she has of the rest.', 'But take care; for she is wicked and\\r\\nfierce, and may not allow you to destroy her.', 'Keep to the West, where\\r\\nthe sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.\"', 'They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West,\\r\\nwalking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies\\r\\nand buttercups.', 'Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put\\r\\non in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer\\r\\ngreen, but pure white.', \"The ribbon around Toto's neck had also lost its\\r\\ngreen color and was as white as Dorothy's dress.\", 'The Emerald City was soon left far behind.', 'As they advanced the ground\\r\\nbecame rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this\\r\\ncountry of the West, and the ground was untilled.', 'In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no\\r\\ntrees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and\\r\\nthe Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with\\r\\nthe Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.', 'Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as\\r\\npowerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere.', 'So, as she sat in\\r\\nthe door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy\\r\\nlying asleep, with her friends all about her.', 'They were a long\\r\\ndistance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her\\r\\ncountry; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.', 'At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great\\r\\nwolves.', 'They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.', '\"Go to those people,\" said the Witch, \"and tear them to pieces.\"', '\"Are you not going to make them your slaves?\"', 'asked the leader of the\\r\\nwolves.', '\"No,\" she answered, \"one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and\\r\\nanother a Lion.', 'None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into\\r\\nsmall pieces.\"', '\"Very well,\" said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed\\r\\nby the others.', 'It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard\\r\\nthe wolves coming.', '\"This is my fight,\" said the Woodman, \"so get behind me and I will meet\\r\\nthem as they come.\"', \"He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of\\r\\nthe wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf's\\r\\nhead from its body, so that it immediately died.\", \"As soon as he could\\r\\nraise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp\\r\\nedge of the Tin Woodman's weapon.\", 'There were forty wolves, and forty\\r\\ntimes a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap\\r\\nbefore the Woodman.', 'Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, \"It\\r\\nwas a good fight, friend.\"', 'They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning.', 'The little girl was\\r\\nquite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the\\r\\nTin Woodman told her all.', 'She thanked him for saving them and sat down\\r\\nto breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.', 'Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle\\r\\nand looked out with her one eye that could see far off.', 'She saw all\\r\\nher wolves lying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her\\r\\ncountry.', 'This made her angrier than before, and she blew her silver\\r\\nwhistle twice.', 'Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough\\r\\nto darken the sky.', 'And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, \"Fly at once to the\\r\\nstrangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.\"', 'The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her\\r\\ncompanions.', 'When the little girl saw them coming she was afraid.', 'But the Scarecrow said, \"This is my battle, so lie down beside me and\\r\\nyou will not be harmed.\"', 'So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up\\r\\nand stretched out his arms.', 'And when the crows saw him they were\\r\\nfrightened, as these birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare\\r\\nto come any nearer.', 'But the King Crow said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It is only a stuffed man.', 'I will peck his eyes out.\"', 'The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and\\r\\ntwisted its neck until it died.', 'And then another crow flew at him, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow twisted its neck also.', 'There were forty crows, and forty\\r\\ntimes the Scarecrow twisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead\\r\\nbeside him.', 'Then he called to his companions to rise, and again they\\r\\nwent upon their journey.', 'When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a\\r\\nheap, she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her\\r\\nsilver whistle.', 'Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of\\r\\nblack bees came flying toward her.', '\"Go to the strangers and sting them to death!\"', 'commanded the Witch, and\\r\\nthe bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and\\r\\nher friends were walking.', 'But the Woodman had seen them coming, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow had decided what to do.', '\"Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and\\r\\nthe Lion,\" he said to the Woodman, \"and the bees cannot sting them.\"', 'This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and held\\r\\nToto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.', 'The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew\\r\\nat him and broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting\\r\\nthe Woodman at all.', 'And as bees cannot live when their stings are\\r\\nbroken that was the end of the black bees, and they lay scattered thick\\r\\nabout the Woodman, like little heaps of fine coal.', 'Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman\\r\\nput the straw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as\\r\\never.', 'So they started upon their journey once more.', 'The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little\\r\\nheaps like fine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and\\r\\ngnashed her teeth.', 'And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were\\r\\nthe Winkies, and gave them sharp spears, telling them to go to the\\r\\nstrangers and destroy them.', 'The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were\\r\\ntold.', 'So they marched away until they came near to Dorothy.', 'Then the\\r\\nLion gave a great roar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies\\r\\nwere so frightened that they ran back as fast as they could.', 'When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a\\r\\nstrap, and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to\\r\\nthink what she should do next.', 'She could not understand how all her\\r\\nplans to destroy these strangers had failed; but she was a powerful\\r\\nWitch, as well as a wicked one, and she soon made up her mind how to\\r\\nact.', 'There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and\\r\\nrubies running round it.', 'This Golden Cap had a charm.', 'Whoever owned\\r\\nit could call three times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any\\r\\norder they were given.', 'But no person could command these strange\\r\\ncreatures more than three times.', 'Twice already the Wicked Witch had\\r\\nused the charm of the Cap.', 'Once was when she had made the Winkies her\\r\\nslaves, and set herself to rule over their country.', 'The Winged Monkeys\\r\\nhad helped her do this.', 'The second time was when she had fought\\r\\nagainst the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the\\r\\nWest.', 'The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this.', 'Only once\\r\\nmore could she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like\\r\\nto do so until all her other powers were exhausted.', 'But now that her\\r\\nfierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and\\r\\nher slaves had been scared away by the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was\\r\\nonly one way left to destroy Dorothy and her friends.', 'So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it\\r\\nupon her head.', 'Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\"', 'Next she stood upon her right foot and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\"', 'After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\"', 'Now the charm began to work.', 'The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling\\r\\nsound was heard in the air.', 'There was a rushing of many wings, a great\\r\\nchattering and laughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show\\r\\nthe Wicked Witch surrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of\\r\\nimmense and powerful wings on his shoulders.', 'One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader.', 'He flew\\r\\nclose to the Witch and said, \"You have called us for the third and last\\r\\ntime.', 'What do you command?\"', '\"Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except\\r\\nthe Lion,\" said the Wicked Witch.', '\"Bring that beast to me, for I have\\r\\na mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.\"', '\"Your commands shall be obeyed,\" said the leader.', 'Then, with a great\\r\\ndeal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place\\r\\nwhere Dorothy and her friends were walking.', 'Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the\\r\\nair until they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks.', 'Here they dropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the\\r\\nrocks, where he lay so battered and dented that he could neither move\\r\\nnor groan.', 'Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers\\r\\npulled all of the straw out of his clothes and head.', 'They made his hat\\r\\nand boots and clothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top\\r\\nbranches of a tall tree.', 'The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and\\r\\nwound many coils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable\\r\\nto bite or scratch or struggle in any way.', \"Then they lifted him up and\\r\\nflew away with him to the Witch's castle, where he was placed in a\\r\\nsmall yard with a high iron fence around it, so that he could not\\r\\nescape.\", 'But Dorothy they did not harm at all.', 'She stood, with Toto in her\\r\\narms, watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon\\r\\nbe her turn.', \"The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his\\r\\nlong, hairy arms stretched out and his ugly face grinning terribly; but\\r\\nhe saw the mark of the Good Witch's kiss upon her forehead and stopped\\r\\nshort, motioning the others not to touch her.\", '\"We dare not harm this little girl,\" he said to them, \"for she is\\r\\nprotected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of\\r\\nEvil.', 'All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch\\r\\nand leave her there.\"', 'So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried\\r\\nher swiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they\\r\\nset her down upon the front doorstep.', 'Then the leader said to the\\r\\nWitch:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have obeyed you as far as we were able.', 'The Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard.', 'The\\r\\nlittle girl we dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms.', 'Your power over our band is now ended, and you will never see us again.\"', 'Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and\\r\\nnoise, flew into the air and were soon out of sight.', \"The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark\\r\\non Dorothy's forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged\\r\\nMonkeys nor she, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way.\", \"She looked\\r\\ndown at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble\\r\\nwith fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them.\", \"At\\r\\nfirst the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened\\r\\nto look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them\\r\\nwas, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the\\r\\nSilver Shoes gave her.\", 'So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\\r\\nthought, \"I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\\r\\nuse her power.\"', 'Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you\\r\\ndo not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow.\"', 'Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\\r\\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\\r\\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.', 'Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\\r\\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\\r\\nher.', 'With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the\\r\\ncourtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\\r\\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to\\r\\ngo to drive.', 'But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and\\r\\nbounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and\\r\\nshut the gate again.', '\"If I cannot harness you,\" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through\\r\\nthe bars of the gate, \"I can starve you.', 'You shall have nothing to eat\\r\\nuntil you do as I wish.\"', 'So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\\r\\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked, \"Are you ready to be harnessed\\r\\nlike a horse?\"', 'And the Lion would answer, \"No.', 'If you come in this yard, I will bite\\r\\nyou.\"', 'The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\\r\\nevery night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from\\r\\nthe cupboard.', 'After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of\\r\\nstraw, and Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft,\\r\\nshaggy mane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some\\r\\nway to escape.', 'But they could find no way to get out of the castle,\\r\\nfor it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the\\r\\nslaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told\\r\\nthem.', 'The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\\r\\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\\r\\nher hand.', 'But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because\\r\\nof the mark upon her forehead.', 'The child did not know this, and was\\r\\nfull of fear for herself and Toto.', 'Once the Witch struck Toto a blow\\r\\nwith her umbrella and the brave little dog flew at her and bit her leg\\r\\nin return.', 'The Witch did not bleed where she was bitten, for she was\\r\\nso wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years before.', \"Dorothy's life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would\\r\\nbe harder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again.\", 'Sometimes\\r\\nshe would cry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and\\r\\nlooking into her face, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for\\r\\nhis little mistress.', 'Toto did not really care whether he was in Kansas\\r\\nor the Land of Oz so long as Dorothy was with him; but he knew the\\r\\nlittle girl was unhappy, and that made him unhappy too.', 'Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver\\r\\nShoes which the girl always wore.', 'Her bees and her crows and her\\r\\nwolves were lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the\\r\\npower of the Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver\\r\\nShoes, they would give her more power than all the other things she had\\r\\nlost.', 'She watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her\\r\\nshoes, thinking she might steal them.', 'But the child was so proud of\\r\\nher pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night and when\\r\\nshe took her bath.', \"The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare\\r\\ngo in Dorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water\\r\\nwas greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when\\r\\nDorothy was bathing.\", 'Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor\\r\\never let water touch her in any way.', 'But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a\\r\\ntrick that would give her what she wanted.', 'She placed a bar of iron in\\r\\nthe middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the\\r\\niron invisible to human eyes.', 'So that when Dorothy walked across the\\r\\nfloor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at\\r\\nfull length.', 'She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver\\r\\nShoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched\\r\\nit away and put it on her own skinny foot.', 'The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for\\r\\nas long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their\\r\\ncharm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how\\r\\nto do so.', 'The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew\\r\\nangry, and said to the Witch, \"Give me back my shoe!\"', '\"I will not,\" retorted the Witch, \"for it is now my shoe, and not\\r\\nyours.\"', '\"You are a wicked creature!\"', 'cried Dorothy.', '\"You have no right to take\\r\\nmy shoe from me.\"', '\"I shall keep it, just the same,\" said the Witch, laughing at her, \"and\\r\\nsomeday I shall get the other one from you, too.\"', 'This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water\\r\\nthat stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to\\r\\nfoot.', 'Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as\\r\\nDorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall\\r\\naway.', '\"See what you have done!\"', 'she screamed.', '\"In a minute I shall melt\\r\\naway.\"', '\"I\\'m very sorry, indeed,\" said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see\\r\\nthe Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.', '\"Didn\\'t you know water would be the end of me?\"', 'asked the Witch, in a\\r\\nwailing, despairing voice.', '\"Of course not,\" answered Dorothy.', '\"How should I?\"', '\"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\\r\\ncastle to yourself.', 'I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought\\r\\na little girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked\\r\\ndeeds.', 'Look out--here I go!\"', 'With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass\\r\\nand began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor.', 'Seeing\\r\\nthat she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket\\r\\nof water and threw it over the mess.', 'She then swept it all out the\\r\\ndoor.', 'After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left\\r\\nof the old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on\\r\\nher foot again.', 'Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran\\r\\nout to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West\\r\\nhad come to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange\\r\\nland.', '13.', 'The Rescue\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had\\r\\nbeen melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate\\r\\nof his prison and set him free.', \"They went in together to the castle,\\r\\nwhere Dorothy's first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell\\r\\nthem that they were no longer slaves.\", 'There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been\\r\\nmade to work hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had\\r\\nalways treated them with great cruelty.', 'They kept this day as a\\r\\nholiday, then and ever after, and spent the time in feasting and\\r\\ndancing.', '\"If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with us,\"\\r\\nsaid the Lion, \"I should be quite happy.\"', '\"Don\\'t you suppose we could rescue them?\"', 'asked the girl anxiously.', '\"We can try,\" answered the Lion.', 'So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to\\r\\nrescue their friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted\\r\\nto do all in their power for Dorothy, who had set them free from\\r\\nbondage.', 'So she chose a number of the Winkies who looked as if they\\r\\nknew the most, and they all started away.', 'They traveled that day and\\r\\npart of the next until they came to the rocky plain where the Tin\\r\\nWoodman lay, all battered and bent.', 'His axe was near him, but the\\r\\nblade was rusted and the handle broken off short.', 'The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to\\r\\nthe Yellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the\\r\\nsad plight of her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry.', 'When they reached the castle Dorothy said to the Winkies:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Are any of your people tinsmiths?\"', '\"Oh, yes.', 'Some of us are very good tinsmiths,\" they told her.', '\"Then bring them to me,\" she said.', 'And when the tinsmiths came,\\r\\nbringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, \"Can you\\r\\nstraighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into\\r\\nshape again, and solder him together where he is broken?\"', 'The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that\\r\\nthey thought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever.', 'So\\r\\nthey set to work in one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and\\r\\nworked for three days and four nights, hammering and twisting and\\r\\nbending and soldering and polishing and pounding at the legs and body\\r\\nand head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was straightened out into\\r\\nhis old form, and his joints worked as well as ever.', 'To be sure, there\\r\\nwere several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job, and as\\r\\nthe Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.', \"When, at last, he walked into Dorothy's room and thanked her for\\r\\nrescuing him, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy\\r\\nhad to wipe every tear carefully from his face with her apron, so his\\r\\njoints would not be rusted.\", 'At the same time her own tears fell thick\\r\\nand fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears\\r\\ndid not need to be wiped away.', 'As for the Lion, he wiped his eyes so\\r\\noften with the tip of his tail that it became quite wet, and he was\\r\\nobliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun till it\\r\\ndried.', '\"If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,\" said the Tin Woodman,\\r\\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, \"I\\r\\nshould be quite happy.\"', '\"We must try to find him,\" said the girl.', \"So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and\\r\\npart of the next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of\\r\\nwhich the Winged Monkeys had tossed the Scarecrow's clothes.\", 'It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could\\r\\nclimb it; but the Woodman said at once, \"I\\'ll chop it down, and then we\\r\\ncan get the Scarecrow\\'s clothes.\"', \"Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself,\\r\\nanother of the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of\\r\\nsolid gold and fitted it to the Woodman's axe, instead of the old\\r\\nbroken handle.\", 'Others polished the blade until all the rust was\\r\\nremoved and it glistened like burnished silver.', \"As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short\\r\\ntime the tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow's clothes\\r\\nfell out of the branches and rolled off on the ground.\", 'Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the\\r\\ncastle, where they were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold!', 'here was the Scarecrow, as good as ever, thanking them over and over\\r\\nagain for saving him.', 'Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy\\r\\ndays at the Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to\\r\\nmake them comfortable.', 'But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, \"We must go back to\\r\\nOz, and claim his promise.\"', '\"Yes,\" said the Woodman, \"at last I shall get my heart.\"', '\"And I shall get my brains,\" added the Scarecrow joyfully.', '\"And I shall get my courage,\" said the Lion thoughtfully.', '\"And I shall get back to Kansas,\" cried Dorothy, clapping her hands.', '\"Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!\"', 'This they decided to do.', 'The next day they called the Winkies together\\r\\nand bade them good-bye.', 'The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and\\r\\nthey had grown so fond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay\\r\\nand rule over them and the Yellow Land of the West.', 'Finding they were\\r\\ndetermined to go, the Winkies gave Toto and the Lion each a golden\\r\\ncollar; and to Dorothy they presented a beautiful bracelet studded with\\r\\ndiamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a gold-headed walking stick,\\r\\nto keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman they offered a\\r\\nsilver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.', 'Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return,\\r\\nand all shook hands with them until their arms ached.', \"Dorothy went to the Witch's cupboard to fill her basket with food for\\r\\nthe journey, and there she saw the Golden Cap.\", 'She tried it on her own\\r\\nhead and found that it fitted her exactly.', 'She did not know anything\\r\\nabout the charm of the Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so\\r\\nshe made up her mind to wear it and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.', 'Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald\\r\\nCity; and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to\\r\\ncarry with them.', '14.', 'The Winged Monkeys\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will remember there was no road--not even a pathway--between the\\r\\ncastle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City.', 'When the four\\r\\ntravelers went in search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so\\r\\nsent the Winged Monkeys to bring them to her.', 'It was much harder to\\r\\nfind their way back through the big fields of buttercups and yellow\\r\\ndaisies than it was being carried.', 'They knew, of course, they must go\\r\\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\\r\\nway.', 'But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did not know\\r\\nwhich was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\\r\\nlost in the great fields.', 'They kept on walking, however, and at night\\r\\nthe moon came out and shone brightly.', 'So they lay down among the sweet\\r\\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning--all but the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.', 'The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\\r\\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.', '\"If we walk far enough,\" said Dorothy, \"I am sure we shall sometime\\r\\ncome to some place.\"', 'But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\\r\\nthe scarlet fields.', 'The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.', '\"We have surely lost our way,\" he said, \"and unless we find it again in\\r\\ntime to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.\"', '\"Nor I my heart,\" declared the Tin Woodman.', '\"It seems to me I can\\r\\nscarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\\r\\njourney.\"', '\"You see,\" said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, \"I haven\\'t the\\r\\ncourage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at all.\"', 'Then Dorothy lost heart.', 'She sat down on the grass and looked at her\\r\\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\\r\\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\\r\\nthat flew past his head.', 'So he put out his tongue and panted and\\r\\nlooked at Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.', '\"Suppose we call the field mice,\" she suggested.', '\"They could probably\\r\\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.\"', '\"To be sure they could,\" cried the Scarecrow.', '\"Why didn\\'t we think of\\r\\nthat before?\"', 'Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck\\r\\nsince the Queen of the Mice had given it to her.', 'In a few minutes they\\r\\nheard the pattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came\\r\\nrunning up to her.', 'Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her\\r\\nsqueaky little voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What can I do for my friends?\"', '\"We have lost our way,\" said Dorothy.', '\"Can you tell us where the\\r\\nEmerald City is?\"', '\"Certainly,\" answered the Queen; \"but it is a great way off, for you\\r\\nhave had it at your backs all this time.\"', 'Then she noticed Dorothy\\'s\\r\\nGolden Cap, and said, \"Why don\\'t you use the charm of the Cap, and call\\r\\nthe Winged Monkeys to you?', 'They will carry you to the City of Oz in\\r\\nless than an hour.\"', '\"I didn\\'t know there was a charm,\" answered Dorothy, in surprise.', '\"What is it?\"', '\"It is written inside the Golden Cap,\" replied the Queen of the Mice.', '\"But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away, for\\r\\nthey are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.\"', '\"Won\\'t they hurt me?\"', 'asked the girl anxiously.', '\"Oh, no.', 'They must obey the wearer of the Cap.', 'Good-bye!\"', 'And she\\r\\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.', 'Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon\\r\\nthe lining.', 'These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the\\r\\ndirections carefully and put the Cap upon her head.', '\"Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!\"', 'she said, standing on her left foot.', '\"What did you say?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she was\\r\\ndoing.', '\"Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!\"', 'Dorothy went on, standing this time on her\\r\\nright foot.', '\"Hello!\"', 'replied the Tin Woodman calmly.', '\"Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!\"', 'said Dorothy, who was now standing on both feet.', 'This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering\\r\\nand flapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.', 'The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, \"What is your command?\"', '\"We wish to go to the Emerald City,\" said the child, \"and we have lost\\r\\nour way.\"', '\"We will carry you,\" replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken than\\r\\ntwo of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.', 'Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little\\r\\nMonkey seized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to\\r\\nbite him.', 'The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for\\r\\nthey remembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before;\\r\\nbut they saw that no harm was intended, so they rode through the air\\r\\nquite cheerfully, and had a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and\\r\\nwoods far below them.', 'Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys,\\r\\none of them the King himself.', 'They had made a chair of their hands and\\r\\nwere careful not to hurt her.', '\"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\"', 'she asked.', '\"That is a long story,\" answered the King, with a winged laugh; \"but as\\r\\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\\r\\nabout it, if you wish.\"', '\"I shall be glad to hear it,\" she replied.', '\"Once,\" began the leader, \"we were a free people, living happily in the\\r\\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\\r\\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master.', 'Perhaps some\\r\\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\\r\\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\\r\\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest.', 'But we were careless and\\r\\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day.', 'This was\\r\\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\\r\\nland.', '\"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\\r\\nwas also a powerful sorceress.', 'All her magic was used to help the\\r\\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good.', 'Her name\\r\\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\\r\\nblocks of ruby.', 'Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\\r\\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\\r\\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise.', 'At last,\\r\\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\\r\\nyears.', 'Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\\r\\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\\r\\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\\r\\nwoman could wish.', 'When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\\r\\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\\r\\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\\r\\nmake everything ready for the wedding.', '\"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\r\\nlived in the forest near Gayelette\\'s palace, and the old fellow loved a\\r\\njoke better than a good dinner.', 'One day, just before the wedding, my\\r\\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\\r\\nbeside the river.', 'He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\\r\\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\\r\\ndo.', 'At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\\r\\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\\r\\ndropped him into the water.', '\"\\'Swim out, my fine fellow,\\' cried my grandfather, \\'and see if the\\r\\nwater has spotted your clothes.\\'', 'Quelala was much too wise not to\\r\\nswim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune.', 'He\\r\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.', 'But when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\\r\\nvelvet all ruined by the river.', '\"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it.', 'She had\\r\\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\\r\\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\\r\\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river.', 'But my grandfather pleaded\\r\\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\\r\\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\\r\\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\\r\\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap.', 'This\\r\\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\\r\\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom.', 'Of course my grandfather and\\r\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\\r\\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\\r\\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.\"', '\"And what became of them?\"', 'asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\\r\\ninterested in the story.', '\"Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,\" replied the Monkey,\\r\\n\"he was the first to lay his wishes upon us.', 'As his bride could not\\r\\nbear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he\\r\\nhad married her and ordered us always to keep where she could never\\r\\nagain set eyes on a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we\\r\\nwere all afraid of her.', '\"This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the\\r\\nhands of the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies,\\r\\nand afterward drive Oz himself out of the Land of the West.', 'Now the\\r\\nGolden Cap is yours, and three times you have the right to lay your\\r\\nwishes upon us.\"', 'As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the\\r\\ngreen, shining walls of the Emerald City before them.', 'She wondered at\\r\\nthe rapid flight of the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over.', 'The strange creatures set the travelers down carefully before the gate\\r\\nof the City, the King bowed low to Dorothy, and then flew swiftly away,\\r\\nfollowed by all his band.', '\"That was a good ride,\" said the little girl.', '\"Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,\" replied the Lion.', '\"How\\r\\nlucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!\"', '15.', 'The Discovery of Oz, the Terrible\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang\\r\\nthe bell.', 'After ringing several times, it was opened by the same\\r\\nGuardian of the Gates they had met before.', '\"What!', 'are you back again?\"', 'he asked, in surprise.', '\"Do you not see us?\"', 'answered the Scarecrow.', '\"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.\"', '\"We did visit her,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"And she let you go again?\"', 'asked the man, in wonder.', '\"She could not help it, for she is melted,\" explained the Scarecrow.', '\"Melted!', 'Well, that is good news, indeed,\" said the man.', '\"Who melted\\r\\nher?\"', '\"It was Dorothy,\" said the Lion gravely.', '\"Good gracious!\"', 'exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before\\r\\nher.', 'Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from\\r\\nthe great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before.', 'Afterward\\r\\nthey passed on through the gate into the Emerald City.', 'When the people\\r\\nheard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked\\r\\nWitch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed\\r\\nthem in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.', 'The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,\\r\\nbut he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful\\r\\ngreen girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they\\r\\nmight rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.', 'The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the\\r\\nother travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;\\r\\nbut Oz made no reply.', 'They thought the Great Wizard would send for\\r\\nthem at once, but he did not.', 'They had no word from him the next day,\\r\\nnor the next, nor the next.', 'The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and\\r\\nat last they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,\\r\\nafter sending them to undergo hardships and slavery.', 'So the Scarecrow\\r\\nat last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if\\r\\nhe did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged\\r\\nMonkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.', \"When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he\\r\\nsent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after\\r\\nnine o'clock the next morning.\", 'He had once met the Winged Monkeys in\\r\\nthe Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.', 'The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift\\r\\nOz had promised to bestow on him.', 'Dorothy fell asleep only once, and\\r\\nthen she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how\\r\\nglad she was to have her little girl at home again.', \"Promptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier\\r\\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room\\r\\nof the Great Oz.\", 'Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he\\r\\nhad taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about\\r\\nand saw no one at all in the room.', 'They kept close to the door and\\r\\ncloser to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more\\r\\ndreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.', 'Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere\\r\\nnear the top of the great dome, and it said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible.', 'Why do you seek me?\"', 'They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,\\r\\nDorothy asked, \"Where are you?\"', '\"I am everywhere,\" answered the Voice, \"but to the eyes of common\\r\\nmortals I am invisible.', 'I will now seat myself upon my throne, that\\r\\nyou may converse with me.\"', 'Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\\r\\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in\\r\\na row while Dorothy said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.\"', '\"What promise?\"', 'asked Oz.', '\"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\\r\\ndestroyed,\" said the girl.', '\"And you promised to give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"And you promised to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"And you promised to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.', '\"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?\"', 'asked the Voice, and Dorothy\\r\\nthought it trembled a little.', '\"Yes,\" she answered, \"I melted her with a bucket of water.\"', '\"Dear me,\" said the Voice, \"how sudden!', 'Well, come to me tomorrow, for\\r\\nI must have time to think it over.\"', '\"You\\'ve had plenty of time already,\" said the Tin Woodman angrily.', '\"We shan\\'t wait a day longer,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"You must keep your promises to us!\"', 'exclaimed Dorothy.', 'The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave\\r\\na large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped\\r\\naway from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a\\r\\ncorner.', 'As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next\\r\\nmoment all of them were filled with wonder.', 'For they saw, standing in\\r\\njust the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head\\r\\nand a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.', 'The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and\\r\\ncried out, \"Who are you?\"', '\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" said the little man, in a trembling\\r\\nvoice.', '\"But don\\'t strike me--please don\\'t--and I\\'ll do anything you\\r\\nwant me to.\"', 'Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.', '\"I thought Oz was a great Head,\" said Dorothy.', '\"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,\" exclaimed the Lion.', '\"No, you are all wrong,\" said the little man meekly.', '\"I have been\\r\\nmaking believe.\"', '\"Making believe!\"', 'cried Dorothy.', '\"Are you not a Great Wizard?\"', '\"Hush, my dear,\" he said.', '\"Don\\'t speak so loud, or you will be\\r\\noverheard--and I should be ruined.', 'I\\'m supposed to be a Great Wizard.\"', '\"And aren\\'t you?\"', 'she asked.', '\"Not a bit of it, my dear; I\\'m just a common man.\"', '\"You\\'re more than that,\" said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \"you\\'re\\r\\na humbug.\"', '\"Exactly so!\"', 'declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if\\r\\nit pleased him.', '\"I am a humbug.\"', '\"But this is terrible,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"How shall I ever get my\\r\\nheart?\"', '\"Or I my courage?\"', 'asked the Lion.', '\"Or I my brains?\"', 'wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes\\r\\nwith his coat sleeve.', '\"My dear friends,\" said Oz, \"I pray you not to speak of these little\\r\\nthings.', 'Think of me, and the terrible trouble I\\'m in at being found\\r\\nout.\"', '\"Doesn\\'t anyone else know you\\'re a humbug?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"No one knows it but you four--and myself,\" replied Oz.', '\"I have fooled\\r\\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out.', 'It was a\\r\\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room.', 'Usually I will\\r\\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\"', '\"But, I don\\'t understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment.', '\"How was it\\r\\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"', '\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz.', '\"Step this way, please, and\\r\\nI will tell you all about it.\"', 'He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\\r\\nthey all followed him.', 'He pointed to one corner, in which lay the\\r\\ngreat Head, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\\r\\npainted face.', '\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz.', '\"I stood behind the\\r\\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"', '\"But how about the voice?\"', 'she inquired.', '\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man.', '\"I can throw the\\r\\nsound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming\\r\\nout of the Head.', 'Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\"', 'He\\r\\nshowed the Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed\\r\\nto be the lovely Lady.', 'And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast\\r\\nwas nothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\\r\\nsides out.', 'As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that\\r\\nalso from the ceiling.', 'It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil\\r\\nwas poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.', '\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\\r\\nbeing such a humbug.\"', '\"I am--I certainly am,\" answered the little man sorrowfully; \"but it\\r\\nwas the only thing I could do.', 'Sit down, please, there are plenty of\\r\\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.\"', 'So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.', '\"I was born in Omaha--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, that isn\\'t very far from Kansas!\"', 'cried Dorothy.', '\"No, but it\\'s farther from here,\" he said, shaking his head at her\\r\\nsadly.', '\"When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was\\r\\nvery well trained by a great master.', 'I can imitate any kind of a bird\\r\\nor beast.\"', 'Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his\\r\\nears and looked everywhere to see where she was.', '\"After a time,\"\\r\\ncontinued Oz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"', '\"What is that?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\\r\\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.', '\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know.\"', '\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\\r\\nthat I couldn\\'t come down again.', 'It went way up above the clouds, so\\r\\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\\r\\naway.', 'For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\\r\\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\\r\\nstrange and beautiful country.', '\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit.', 'But I found myself\\r\\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\\r\\nthought I was a great Wizard.', 'Of course I let them think so, because\\r\\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.', '\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\r\\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.', 'Then I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\\r\\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\\r\\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"', '\"But isn\\'t everything here green?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\\r\\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you.', 'The\\r\\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\\r\\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now.', 'But my\\r\\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\\r\\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\\r\\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\\r\\nthat is needed to make one happy.', 'I have been good to the people, and\\r\\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\\r\\nup and would not see any of them.', '\"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\r\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\\r\\nwonderful things.', 'There were four of them in this country, and they\\r\\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.', 'Fortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\\r\\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\\r\\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\\r\\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me.', 'As it was, I lived in\\r\\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\\r\\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.', 'When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\\r\\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\\r\\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"', '\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.', '\"Oh, no, my dear; I\\'m really a very good man, but I\\'m a very bad\\r\\nWizard, I must admit.\"', '\"Can\\'t you give me brains?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow.', '\"You don\\'t need them.', 'You are learning something every day.', \"A baby\\r\\nhas brains, but it doesn't know much.\", 'Experience is the only thing\\r\\nthat brings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more\\r\\nexperience you are sure to get.\"', '\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\\r\\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"', 'The false Wizard looked at him carefully.', '\"Well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I\\'m not much of a magician, as I said;\\r\\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\\r\\nwith brains.', 'I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\\r\\nthat out for yourself.\"', '\"Oh, thank you--thank you!\"', 'cried the Scarecrow.', '\"I\\'ll find a way to\\r\\nuse them, never fear!\"', '\"But how about my courage?\"', 'asked the Lion anxiously.', '\"You have plenty of courage, I am sure,\" answered Oz.', '\"All you need is\\r\\nconfidence in yourself.', 'There is no living thing that is not afraid\\r\\nwhen it faces danger.', 'The True courage is in facing danger when you\\r\\nare afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\"', '\"Perhaps I have, but I\\'m scared just the same,\" said the Lion.', '\"I\\r\\nshall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage\\r\\nthat makes one forget he is afraid.\"', '\"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\" replied Oz.', '\"How about my heart?\"', 'asked the Tin Woodman.', '\"Why, as for that,\" answered Oz, \"I think you are wrong to want a\\r\\nheart.', 'It makes most people unhappy.', 'If you only knew it, you are in\\r\\nluck not to have a heart.\"', '\"That must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Tin Woodman.', '\"For my\\r\\npart, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will\\r\\ngive me the heart.\"', '\"Very well,\" answered Oz meekly.', '\"Come to me tomorrow and you shall\\r\\nhave a heart.', 'I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as\\r\\nwell continue the part a little longer.\"', '\"And now,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\"', '\"We shall have to think about that,\" replied the little man.', '\"Give me\\r\\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I\\'ll try to find a way to\\r\\ncarry you over the desert.', 'In the meantime you shall all be treated as\\r\\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\\r\\nyou and obey your slightest wish.', 'There is only one thing I ask in\\r\\nreturn for my help--such as it is.', 'You must keep my secret and tell no\\r\\none I am a humbug.\"', 'They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\\r\\ntheir rooms in high spirits.', 'Even Dorothy had hope that \"The Great and\\r\\nTerrible Humbug,\" as she called him, would find a way to send her back\\r\\nto Kansas, and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.', '16.', 'The Magic Art of the Great Humbug\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Congratulate me.', 'I am going to Oz to get my brains at last.', 'When I\\r\\nreturn I shall be as other men are.\"', '\"I have always liked you as you were,\" said Dorothy simply.', '\"It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,\" he replied.', '\"But surely you\\r\\nwill think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new brain\\r\\nis going to turn out.\"', 'Then he said good-bye to them all in a cheerful\\r\\nvoice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.', '\"Come in,\" said Oz.', 'The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the\\r\\nwindow, engaged in deep thought.', '\"I have come for my brains,\" remarked the Scarecrow, a little uneasily.', '\"Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,\" replied Oz.', '\"You must\\r\\nexcuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order\\r\\nto put your brains in their proper place.\"', '\"That\\'s all right,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"You are quite welcome to take\\r\\nmy head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it on\\r\\nagain.\"', 'So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw.', 'Then he\\r\\nentered the back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed\\r\\nwith a great many pins and needles.', \"Having shaken them together\\r\\nthoroughly, he filled the top of the Scarecrow's head with the mixture\\r\\nand stuffed the rest of the space with straw, to hold it in place.\", 'When he had fastened the Scarecrow\\'s head on his body again he said to\\r\\nhim, \"Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of\\r\\nbran-new brains.\"', 'The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his\\r\\ngreatest wish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.', 'Dorothy looked at him curiously.', 'His head was quite bulged out at the\\r\\ntop with brains.', '\"How do you feel?\"', 'she asked.', '\"I feel wise indeed,\" he answered earnestly.', '\"When I get used to my\\r\\nbrains I shall know everything.\"', '\"Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?\"', 'asked the\\r\\nTin Woodman.', '\"That is proof that he is sharp,\" remarked the Lion.', '\"Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,\" said the Woodman.', 'So he\\r\\nwalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.', '\"Come in,\" called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, \"I have come\\r\\nfor my heart.\"', '\"Very well,\" answered the little man.', '\"But I shall have to cut a hole\\r\\nin your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place.', 'I hope it\\r\\nwon\\'t hurt you.\"', '\"Oh, no,\" answered the Woodman.', '\"I shall not feel it at all.\"', \"So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith's shears and cut a small, square hole\\r\\nin the left side of the Tin Woodman's breast.\", 'Then, going to a chest\\r\\nof drawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and\\r\\nstuffed with sawdust.', '\"Isn\\'t it a beauty?\"', 'he asked.', '\"It is, indeed!\"', 'replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased.', '\"But is\\r\\nit a kind heart?\"', '\"Oh, very!\"', 'answered Oz.', \"He put the heart in the Woodman's breast and\\r\\nthen replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where it\\r\\nhad been cut.\", '\"There,\" said he; \"now you have a heart that any man might be proud of.', 'I\\'m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really couldn\\'t\\r\\nbe helped.\"', '\"Never mind the patch,\" exclaimed the happy Woodman.', '\"I am very\\r\\ngrateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.\"', '\"Don\\'t speak of it,\" replied Oz.', 'Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy\\r\\non account of his good fortune.', 'The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.', '\"Come in,\" said Oz.', '\"I have come for my courage,\" announced the Lion, entering the room.', '\"Very well,\" answered the little man; \"I will get it for you.\"', 'He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a\\r\\nsquare green bottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold\\r\\ndish, beautifully carved.', 'Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who\\r\\nsniffed at it as if he did not like it, the Wizard said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Drink.\"', '\"What is it?\"', 'asked the Lion.', '\"Well,\" answered Oz, \"if it were inside of you, it would be courage.', 'You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this\\r\\nreally cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it.', 'Therefore\\r\\nI advise you to drink it as soon as possible.\"', 'The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.', '\"How do you feel now?\"', 'asked Oz.', '\"Full of courage,\" replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his\\r\\nfriends to tell them of his good fortune.', 'Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought\\r\\nthey wanted.', '\"How can I help being a humbug,\" he said, \"when all these\\r\\npeople make me do things that everybody knows can\\'t be done?', 'It was\\r\\neasy to make the Scarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because\\r\\nthey imagined I could do anything.', 'But it will take more than\\r\\nimagination to carry Dorothy back to Kansas, and I\\'m sure I don\\'t know\\r\\nhow it can be done.\"', '17.', 'How the Balloon Was Launched\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz.', 'These were sad days for\\r\\nthe little girl, although her friends were all quite happy and\\r\\ncontented.', 'The Scarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in\\r\\nhis head; but he would not say what they were because he knew no one\\r\\ncould understand them but himself.', 'When the Tin Woodman walked about\\r\\nhe felt his heart rattling around in his breast; and he told Dorothy he\\r\\nhad discovered it to be a kinder and more tender heart than the one he\\r\\nhad owned when he was made of flesh.', 'The Lion declared he was afraid\\r\\nof nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the\\r\\nfierce Kalidahs.', 'Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed\\r\\nmore than ever to get back to Kansas.', 'On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she\\r\\nentered the Throne Room he greeted her pleasantly:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this\\r\\ncountry.\"', '\"And back to Kansas?\"', 'she asked eagerly.', '\"Well, I\\'m not sure about Kansas,\" said Oz, \"for I haven\\'t the faintest\\r\\nnotion which way it lies.', 'But the first thing to do is to cross the\\r\\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\"', '\"How can I cross the desert?\"', 'she inquired.', '\"Well, I\\'ll tell you what I think,\" said the little man.', '\"You see,\\r\\nwhen I came to this country it was in a balloon.', 'You also came through\\r\\nthe air, being carried by a cyclone.', 'So I believe the best way to get\\r\\nacross the desert will be through the air.', 'Now, it is quite beyond my\\r\\npowers to make a cyclone; but I\\'ve been thinking the matter over, and I\\r\\nbelieve I can make a balloon.\"', '\"How?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"A balloon,\" said Oz, \"is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\\r\\nkeep the gas in it.', 'I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\\r\\nno trouble to make the balloon.', 'But in all this country there is no\\r\\ngas to fill the balloon with, to make it float.\"', '\"If it won\\'t float,\" remarked Dorothy, \"it will be of no use to us.\"', '\"True,\" answered Oz.', '\"But there is another way to make it float, which\\r\\nis to fill it with hot air.', 'Hot air isn\\'t as good as gas, for if the\\r\\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\\r\\nshould be lost.\"', '\"We!\"', 'exclaimed the girl.', '\"Are you going with me?\"', '\"Yes, of course,\" replied Oz.', '\"I am tired of being such a humbug.', 'If\\r\\nI should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\\r\\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.', 'So I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.', 'I\\'d much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\"', '\"I shall be glad to have your company,\" said Dorothy.', '\"Thank you,\" he answered.', '\"Now, if you will help me sew the silk\\r\\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.\"', 'So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips\\r\\nof silk into proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together.', 'First\\r\\nthere was a strip of light green silk, then a strip of dark green and\\r\\nthen a strip of emerald green; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon\\r\\nin different shades of the color about them.', 'It took three days to sew\\r\\nall the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of\\r\\ngreen silk more than twenty feet long.', 'Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it\\r\\nairtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.', '\"But we must have a basket to ride in,\" he said.', 'So he sent the\\r\\nsoldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he\\r\\nfastened with many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.', 'When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to\\r\\nmake a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds.', 'The\\r\\nnews spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the\\r\\nwonderful sight.', 'Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the\\r\\npeople gazed upon it with much curiosity.', 'The Tin Woodman had chopped\\r\\na big pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the\\r\\nbottom of the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from\\r\\nit would be caught in the silken bag.', 'Gradually the balloon swelled\\r\\nout and rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the\\r\\nground.', 'Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am now going away to make a visit.', 'While I am gone the Scarecrow\\r\\nwill rule over you.', 'I command you to obey him as you would me.\"', 'The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to\\r\\nthe ground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much\\r\\nlighter in weight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into\\r\\nthe sky.', '\"Come, Dorothy!\"', 'cried the Wizard.', '\"Hurry up, or the balloon will fly\\r\\naway.\"', '\"I can\\'t find Toto anywhere,\" replied Dorothy, who did not wish to\\r\\nleave her little dog behind.', 'Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a\\r\\nkitten, and Dorothy at last found him.', 'She picked him up and ran\\r\\ntowards the balloon.', 'She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to\\r\\nhelp her into the basket, when, crack!', 'went the ropes, and the balloon\\r\\nrose into the air without her.', '\"Come back!\"', 'she screamed.', '\"I want to go, too!\"', '\"I can\\'t come back, my dear,\" called Oz from the basket.', '\"Good-bye!\"', '\"Good-bye!\"', 'shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to where\\r\\nthe Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and\\r\\nfarther into the sky.', 'And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard,\\r\\nthough he may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we\\r\\nknow.', 'But the people remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oz was always our friend.', 'When he was here he built for us this\\r\\nbeautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise\\r\\nScarecrow to rule over us.\"', 'Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful\\r\\nWizard, and would not be comforted.', '18.', 'Away to the South\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas\\r\\nagain; but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone\\r\\nup in a balloon.', 'And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her\\r\\ncompanions.', 'The Tin Woodman came to her and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave\\r\\nme my lovely heart.', 'I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone,\\r\\nif you will kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.\"', '\"With pleasure,\" she answered, and brought a towel at once.', 'Then the\\r\\nTin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears\\r\\ncarefully and wiped them away with the towel.', 'When he had finished, he\\r\\nthanked her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled\\r\\noil-can, to guard against mishap.', 'The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he\\r\\nwas not a Wizard the people were proud of him.', '\"For,\" they said,\\r\\n\"there is not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed\\r\\nman.\"', 'And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.', 'The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers\\r\\nmet in the Throne Room and talked matters over.', 'The Scarecrow sat in\\r\\nthe big throne and the others stood respectfully before him.', '\"We are not so unlucky,\" said the new ruler, \"for this Palace and the\\r\\nEmerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please.', 'When I\\r\\nremember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer\\'s\\r\\ncornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am\\r\\nquite satisfied with my lot.\"', '\"I also,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"am well-pleased with my new heart;\\r\\nand, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.\"', '\"For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that\\r\\never lived, if not braver,\" said the Lion modestly.', '\"If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,\"\\r\\ncontinued the Scarecrow, \"we might all be happy together.\"', '\"But I don\\'t want to live here,\" cried Dorothy.', '\"I want to go to\\r\\nKansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.\"', '\"Well, then, what can be done?\"', 'inquired the Woodman.', 'The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins\\r\\nand needles began to stick out of his brains.', 'Finally he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\\r\\ndesert?\"', '\"I never thought of that!\"', 'said Dorothy joyfully.', '\"It\\'s just the\\r\\nthing.', 'I\\'ll go at once for the Golden Cap.\"', 'When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\\r\\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\\r\\nstood beside her.', '\"This is the second time you have called us,\" said the Monkey King,\\r\\nbowing before the little girl.', '\"What do you wish?\"', '\"I want you to fly with me to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.', 'But the Monkey King shook his head.', '\"That cannot be done,\" he said.', '\"We belong to this country alone, and\\r\\ncannot leave it.', \"There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\\r\\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there.\", 'We\\r\\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\\r\\nthe desert.', 'Good-bye.\"', 'And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\\r\\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.', 'Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment.', '\"I have wasted the charm\\r\\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,\" she said, \"for the Winged Monkeys\\r\\ncannot help me.\"', '\"It is certainly too bad!\"', 'said the tender-hearted Woodman.', 'The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\\r\\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.', '\"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\" he said, \"and ask\\r\\nhis advice.\"', 'So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\\r\\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.', '\"This little girl,\" said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \"wishes to cross\\r\\nthe desert.', 'How can she do so?\"', '\"I cannot tell,\" answered the soldier, \"for nobody has ever crossed the\\r\\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.\"', '\"Is there no one who can help me?\"', 'asked Dorothy earnestly.', '\"Glinda might,\" he suggested.', '\"Who is Glinda?\"', 'inquired the Scarecrow.', '\"The Witch of the South.', 'She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\\r\\nand rules over the Quadlings.', 'Besides, her castle stands on the edge\\r\\nof the desert, so she may know a way to cross it.\"', '\"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn\\'t she?\"', 'asked the child.', '\"The Quadlings think she is good,\" said the soldier, \"and she is kind\\r\\nto everyone.', 'I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\\r\\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.\"', '\"How can I get to her castle?\"', 'asked Dorothy.', '\"The road is straight to the South,\" he answered, \"but it is said to be\\r\\nfull of dangers to travelers.', 'There are wild beasts in the woods, and\\r\\na race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country.', 'For this reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.\"', 'The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\\r\\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her.', 'For, of\\r\\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\"', '\"You must have been thinking again,\" remarked the Tin Woodman.', '\"I have,\" said the Scarecrow.', '\"I shall go with Dorothy,\" declared the Lion, \"for I am tired of your\\r\\ncity and long for the woods and the country again.', 'I am really a wild\\r\\nbeast, you know.', 'Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.\"', '\"That is true,\" agreed the Woodman.', '\"My axe may be of service to her;\\r\\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.\"', '\"When shall we start?\"', 'asked the Scarecrow.', '\"Are you going?\"', 'they asked, in surprise.', '\"Certainly.', \"If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\", 'She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\\r\\nEmerald City.', 'So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\\r\\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\"', '\"Thank you,\" said Dorothy gratefully.', '\"You are all very kind to me.', 'But I should like to start as soon as possible.\"', '\"We shall go tomorrow morning,\" returned the Scarecrow.', '\"So now let us\\r\\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.\"', '19.', 'Attacked by the Fighting Trees\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and\\r\\nthey all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had\\r\\nwalked with them as far as the gate.', 'When the Guardian of the Gate saw\\r\\nthem again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City\\r\\nto get into new trouble.', 'But he at once unlocked their spectacles,\\r\\nwhich he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to\\r\\ncarry with them.', '\"You are now our ruler,\" he said to the Scarecrow; \"so you must come\\r\\nback to us as soon as possible.\"', '\"I certainly shall if I am able,\" the Scarecrow replied; \"but I must\\r\\nhelp Dorothy to get home, first.\"', 'As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has\\r\\nbeen good to me.', 'I cannot tell you how grateful I am.\"', '\"Don\\'t try, my dear,\" he answered.', '\"We should like to keep you with\\r\\nus, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will find a\\r\\nway.\"', 'He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked forth\\r\\nand started upon their journey.', 'The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the\\r\\nLand of the South.', 'They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed\\r\\nand chatted together.', 'Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of\\r\\ngetting home, and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were glad to be of\\r\\nuse to her.', 'As for the Lion, he sniffed the fresh air with delight and\\r\\nwhisked his tail from side to side in pure joy at being in the country\\r\\nagain, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths and butterflies,\\r\\nbarking merrily all the time.', '\"City life does not agree with me at all,\" remarked the Lion, as they\\r\\nwalked along at a brisk pace.', '\"I have lost much flesh since I lived\\r\\nthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\\r\\ncourageous I have grown.\"', 'They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City.', 'All they\\r\\ncould see was a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and\\r\\nhigh up above everything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.', '\"Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,\" said the Tin Woodman, as he\\r\\nfelt his heart rattling around in his breast.', '\"He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,\" said the\\r\\nScarecrow.', '\"If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,\" added the\\r\\nLion, \"he would have been a brave man.\"', 'Dorothy said nothing.', 'Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he\\r\\nhad done his best, so she forgave him.', 'As he said, he was a good man,\\r\\neven if he was a bad Wizard.', \"The first day's journey was through the green fields and bright flowers\\r\\nthat stretched about the Emerald City on every side.\", 'They slept that\\r\\nnight on the grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they\\r\\nrested very well indeed.', 'In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood.', 'There\\r\\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\\r\\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\\r\\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost.', 'So they\\r\\nlooked for the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.', 'The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\\r\\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\\r\\nunderneath.', 'So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came\\r\\nunder the first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the\\r\\nnext minute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\\r\\nfellow travelers.', 'This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\\r\\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.', '\"Here is another space between the trees,\" called the Lion.', '\"Let me try it first,\" said the Scarecrow, \"for it doesn\\'t hurt me to\\r\\nget thrown about.\"', 'He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\\r\\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.', '\"This is strange,\" exclaimed Dorothy.', '\"What shall we do?\"', '\"The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\\r\\njourney,\" remarked the Lion.', '\"I believe I will try it myself,\" said the Woodman, and shouldering his\\r\\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\\r\\nroughly.', 'When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\\r\\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two.', 'At once the tree began\\r\\nshaking all its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed\\r\\nsafely under it.', '\"Come on!\"', 'he shouted to the others.', '\"Be quick!\"', 'They all ran forward\\r\\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\\r\\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled.', 'But the Woodman promptly\\r\\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.', 'The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\\r\\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\\r\\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\\r\\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\\r\\nof it.']\n"
